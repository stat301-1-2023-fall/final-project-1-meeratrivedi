## Introduction:

Though Rachel Green has the most lines of the main characters in *Friends* and Phoebe Buffay has the least, all of the main characters deliver around the same amount of lines of each emotion so each has a mostly equal opportunity to show their emotional range as actors. Though David Crane, Marta Kauffman, and Kevin S. Bright are the original executive producers of the show, they did not write and direct more episodes than any of the other writers and directors that worked on the show. IMDB Ratings and millions of views in the United States are both useful measures of episode popularity and have a positive relationship with each other. 


## The Characters of *Friends*

The 90s Sitcom Friends was created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, who have stated in interviews that they designed *Friends* to have an ensemble of main characters and give all 6 main characters equal co-star status. However, one person is bound to have the most lines, and that turned out to be Rachel Green, with 9312 lines and Ross Geller as a close second with 9157 lines. Phoebe Buffay had the least amount of lines at 7501. This is quite a discrepancy. Upon learning this I began to rethink the show and question if Crane and Kauffman's intentions were truly carried out. I began to wonder if Rachel was the star of the show. If she was, it may make sense since the show begins when she joins the friend group, and maybe that was by design to follow her journey with the other 5. Then I remembered a line in the show that acknowledges why Phoebe may appear less, saying she lives far away and isn't related to anyone in the friend group so she is the most distant friend. However, after exploring the emotions variable, I learned not to make conclusions about star quality this way. It was difficult to make conclusions with the level of missingness but even though it seems like Rachel and Ross stand out because they have more lines, everyone has an almost equal chance to show off their emotional range as actors. As someone with acting experience, that is more valuable than a line count in terms of star quality. All 6 of these actors got to use this show as an opportunity to explore a variety of different emotions and prove their ability.

## Writers and Directors

Because the original executive producers, David Crane, Marta Kauffman, and Kevin S. Bright have their names appear on the screen at the end of every episode of *Friends* I always believed as a viewer that Crane and Kauffman were the writers and Kevin S. Bright was the director. I did not realize how much collaboration there is in the television industry. There were many other writers and directors that worked on this show throughout the 10 years. I learned that being a producer does not equate to writing or directing more than anyone else, as shown by the fact that the three original producers did not write or direct more than anyone else they brought on. Gary Halvorson directed the most episodes and Alexa Junge wrote the most episodes, two names I had never heard of. I also learned that David Schwimmer, a main character, got the opportunity to direct. I wonder how that impacted how he was portrayed as an actor. A next step could be to focus on the episodes he directed and explore if he possibly gave himself more lines? Overall, many different people got the opportunity to write and direct on this show.

## The Popularity of the Episodes

*Friends* clearly was an incredibly successful show, consistently getting millions of views and high ratings. The range of views per episode on average was between 20 and 30 million, which means the show was consistently popular throughout the 10 years it ran, and is still incredibly popular to this day. A next step would be to reevaluate how views were calculated since the show still brings in views on other platforms that stream not only clips but full episodes. The range of IMDB ratings on average was between 7 and 10, which is incredible. Over time the IMDB rating distribution started to skew slightly more left showing the show was getting higher ratings slightly more frequently over time, which shows improvement from an already great start, but views fluctuated a lot and thus cannot be predicted with time. These two metrics of popularity had a positive relationship with each other but because of how consistently well the show was doing and how small the ranges of values for both metrics were, values only really appeared for impressive levels of both metrics.. The only overlap between the top 5 rated episodes and viewed episodes is the series finale. Out of the top 5 of each, that is the only episode that appeared in both, which means we could conclude that it is the most popular episode.
