"Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.",Rachel Green,1,1,1,56

And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!",Rachel Green,1,1,2,11

"Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...",Monica Geller,1,1,8,8

Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!,Monica Geller,1,1,8,12
"...Yeah. Yeah, I do.",Monica Geller,1,1,8,14
Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!,Rachel Green,1,1,9,2
"Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?",Ross Geller,1,1,10,1

"You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?",Joey Tribbiani,1,1,11,33
So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.,Monica Geller,1,1,11,34
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.,Rachel Green,1,1,11,35

"Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?",Monica Geller,1,1,13,2
I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.,Ross Geller,1,1,13,3
I hate men! I hate men!,Monica Geller,1,1,13,4
"Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.",Phoebe Buffay,1,1,13,5

Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.,Rachel Green,1,2,1,4
Absolutely.,Monica Geller,1,2,1,5
"Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.",Chandler Bing,1,2,1,6
"Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.",Ross Geller,1,2,1,7
"The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.",Chandler Bing,1,2,1,8
"Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.",Rachel Green,1,2,1,9
....Are we still talking about sex?,Joey Tribbiani,1,2,1,10
"No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?",Ross Geller,1,2,2,1
Does she.,Ross Geller,1,2,2,3
"Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?",Ross Geller,1,2,2,5

"Okay, okay, yes, it is. How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.",Ross Geller,1,2,2,10

"Why- why are you here, Carol?",Ross Geller,1,2,2,20

...Then I've already seen this one!,Phoebe Buffay,1,2,3,2
Are you through with that?,Monica Geller,1,2,3,3
"Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.",Joey Tribbiani,1,2,3,4
Whose little ball of paper is this?!,Monica Geller,1,2,3,5
"Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... ...now I wish I was dead.",Chandler Bing,1,2,3,6
"She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!",Phoebe Buffay,1,2,3,8
"Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.",Monica Geller,1,2,3,9
"Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.",Chandler Bing,1,2,3,10
"Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.",Phoebe Buffay,1,2,3,11
"Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.",Joey Tribbiani,1,2,3,12
"That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.",Monica Geller,1,2,3,13
"Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!",Chandler Bing,1,2,3,14
What?,Monica Geller,1,2,3,15
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!,Chandler Bing,1,2,3,16

"Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....",Rachel Green,1,2,3,21
"No, look, don't touch that!",Phoebe Buffay,1,2,3,22
"Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...",Rachel Green,1,2,3,23
"Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!",Monica Geller,1,2,3,24
"Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?",Joey Tribbiani,1,2,3,26

"Oh, I am sorry...",Rachel Green,1,2,3,33
I gave you one job!,Monica Geller,1,2,3,34
"Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!",Rachel Green,1,2,3,35
"Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...",Chandler Bing,1,2,3,36
I just... can't do it.,Monica Geller,1,2,3,37

"Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?",Chandler Bing,1,2,3,46
"Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?",Rachel Green,1,2,3,47
"Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.",Ross Geller,1,2,3,48
She is so great! I miss her.,Phoebe Buffay,1,2,3,49
What does she mean by 'involved'?,Monica Geller,1,2,3,50
"I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.",Chandler Bing,1,2,3,51
"Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.",Ross Geller,1,2,3,52
So what are you gonna do?,Rachel Green,1,2,3,53
"I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.",Ross Geller,1,2,3,54
".....Well, this is still ruined, right?",Joey Tribbiani,1,2,3,56

"Aw, Mom...",Ross Geller,1,2,4,7
"I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?",Monica Geller,1,2,4,8
"No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.",Monica Geller,1,2,4,10
"Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?",Monica Geller,1,2,4,12
Yeah.,Ross Geller,1,2,4,13
"I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.",Monica Geller,1,2,4,15
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!,Ross Geller,1,2,4,18
What's that supposed to mean?,Monica Geller,1,2,4,20
No it's not.,Monica Geller,1,2,4,22
"Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...",Ross Geller,1,2,4,23
"Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.",Ross Geller,1,2,4,25
"...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.",Ross Geller,1,2,4,27
"So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?",Monica Geller,1,2,4,28
"Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.",Ross Geller,1,2,4,29
"Your folks are really that bad, huh?",Joey Tribbiani,1,2,5,1
"Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.",Ross Geller,1,2,5,2
"Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.",Monica Geller,1,2,5,3
Must pee.,Ross Geller,1,2,5,4
"Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.",Phoebe Buffay,1,2,5,5
You're twins?,Rachel Green,1,2,5,6
"Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.",Phoebe Buffay,1,2,5,7
What does she do?,Chandler Bing,1,2,5,8
She's a waitress.,Phoebe Buffay,1,2,5,9
"All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.",Rachel Green,1,2,5,10
"Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.",Monica Geller,1,2,5,11
"Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.",Chandler Bing,1,2,5,12
"The lights, please..",Rachel Green,1,2,5,13
...How long was I in there?,Ross Geller,1,2,5,15
I'm just cleaning up.,Rachel Green,1,2,5,16
D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?,Ross Geller,1,2,5,17

Mm-hmm..,Ross Geller,1,2,5,21
A lot.,Rachel Green,1,2,5,22
Mm.,Ross Geller,1,2,5,23
"So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?",Rachel Green,1,2,5,24
"Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...",Ross Geller,1,2,5,25
"Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?",Rachel Green,1,2,5,26
Got me.,Ross Geller,1,2,5,27
Remember when we were in high school together?,Rachel Green,1,2,5,28

"So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?",Ross Geller,1,2,8,1
"Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?",Ross Geller,1,2,8,3

"Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?",Ross Geller,1,2,8,9
"'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?",Ross Geller,1,2,8,12
"Oh, not much. I-I got a job.",Rachel Green,1,2,9,2

"Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!",Rachel Green,1,2,9,10
"Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!",Rachel Green,1,2,9,12
And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!,Rachel Green,1,2,9,14
Okay..,Rachel Green,1,2,9,16
Wow.,Rachel Green,1,2,9,18
What?,Rachel Green,1,2,9,20
"Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.",Rachel Green,1,2,9,22
Helen Geller? I don't think so.,Ross Geller,1,2,10,2
Thank you!,Ross Geller,1,2,10,4
"What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?",Ross Geller,1,2,10,6
"Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?",Ross Geller,1,2,10,8

"No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.",Ross Geller,1,2,10,13
"Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.",Ross Geller,1,2,10,15
"My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-",Ross Geller,1,2,10,17
"You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.",Ross Geller,1,2,10,21
Oh my God.,Ross Geller,1,2,10,23

What are we supposed to be seeing here?,Joey Tribbiani,1,2,11,2
"I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.",Chandler Bing,1,2,11,3
"You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.",Phoebe Buffay,1,2,11,4
"Then don't do that, alright?",Ross Geller,1,2,11,5
Okay!,Phoebe Buffay,1,2,11,6

Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose.

Hi guys!,Phoebe Buffay,1,3,1,1
"Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?",Ross Geller,1,3,1,3

"What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?",Rachel Green,1,3,1,6
"Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.",Monica Geller,1,3,1,7
Since when?,Rachel Green,1,3,1,8
"Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.",Joey Tribbiani,1,3,1,9
Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.,Chandler Bing,1,3,1,10
"Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.",Phoebe Buffay,1,3,1,11
And everybody knows this?,Rachel Green,1,3,1,12
Yeah. Cushions the blow.,Joey Tribbiani,1,3,1,13
"Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.",Chandler Bing,1,3,1,14

"Uh, Ross.",Monica Geller,1,3,1,16
"What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!",Ross Geller,1,3,1,17

"It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.",Chandler Bing,1,3,2,21

Y'miss it?,Joey Tribbiani,1,3,2,24
"Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God.",Chandler Bing,1,3,2,25
"No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.",Monica Geller,1,3,3,1
That's ridiculous!,Joey Tribbiani,1,3,3,3
Can I use.. either thumb?,Ross Geller,1,3,3,4

"Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!",Rachel Green,1,3,3,19
"Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...",Phoebe Buffay,1,3,3,20

Nope. Schhorry.,Monica Geller,1,3,3,47

...What shoe?,Ross Geller,1,3,5,37
"From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'",Phoebe Buffay,1,3,5,38

Ohhh... I'm fine.,Rachel Green,1,4,16,14
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.,Monica Geller,1,5,1,1
"Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?",Ross Geller,1,5,1,2
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.,Rachel Green,1,5,1,3
"We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.",Chandler Bing,1,5,1,4

"Oh, right, right, shut up.",Chandler Bing,1,5,2,5
"Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.",Monica Geller,1,5,2,6
"No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.",Chandler Bing,1,5,2,7
"Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.",Joey Tribbiani,1,5,2,8
"You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.",Phoebe Buffay,1,5,2,9
"Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.",Chandler Bing,1,5,2,10

Does anybody want anything else?,Rachel Green,1,5,2,15
"Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.",Ross Geller,1,5,2,16
What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?,Phoebe Buffay,1,5,2,17
It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.,Rachel Green,1,5,2,18
"That guy, he burns me up.",Ross Geller,1,5,2,19
"Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.",Rachel Green,1,5,2,20
"Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.",Chandler Bing,1,5,2,21
"Did he give you that whole ""You're-not-up-to-this"" thing again?",Monica Geller,1,5,2,22
"Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of ""You'll never make it on your own"".",Rachel Green,1,5,2,23
"Uh-huh, uh-huh.",Phoebe Buffay,1,5,2,24
"My god, Angela.",Joey Tribbiani,1,5,2,27
"Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.",Monica Geller,1,5,2,29
Are you gonna go over there?,Phoebe Buffay,1,5,2,30

"Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?",Ross Geller,1,5,2,39
Who?,Rachel Green,1,5,2,40
"Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?",Ross Geller,1,5,2,41
Don't you have a laundry room in your building?,Rachel Green,1,5,2,42
"Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?",Ross Geller,1,5,2,43
Sure.,Rachel Green,1,5,2,44
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?,Joey Tribbiani,1,5,2,47

What?,Joey Tribbiani,1,5,3,5
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!,Monica Geller,1,5,3,6

What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.,Monica Geller,1,5,3,8
"I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?",Joey Tribbiani,1,5,3,9
"Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.",Ross Geller,1,5,4,1
"Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?",Chandler Bing,1,5,4,2
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.,Ross Geller,1,5,4,3
"It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.",Chandler Bing,1,5,4,4
Nuh-uh.,Ross Geller,1,5,4,5

"Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?",Ross Geller,1,5,7,26
"Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?",Rachel Green,1,5,7,27
"Rach, have you never done this before?",Ross Geller,1,5,7,28
"Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.",Rachel Green,1,5,7,29
"Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.",Ross Geller,1,5,7,30
"Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?",Rachel Green,1,5,7,31

Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.,Monica Geller,1,5,10,5

"Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.",Chandler Bing,1,5,11,3
"Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.",Rachel Green,1,5,12,1
"That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.",Ross Geller,1,5,12,2
What uh-oh?,Rachel Green,1,5,12,3

"Oh, everything's pink.",Rachel Green,1,5,12,9
"Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.",Ross Geller,1,5,12,10
"Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!",Rachel Green,1,5,12,11
"Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?",Monica Geller,1,5,13,1
Oh my god.,Monica Geller,1,5,13,3

"Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...",Joey Tribbiani,1,5,13,10
"Oh my god, what were you thinking?",Monica Geller,1,5,13,11
"All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.",Joey Tribbiani,1,5,13,12
Oh!,Monica Geller,1,5,13,13

"Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.",Joey Tribbiani,1,5,13,16
Really?,Monica Geller,1,5,13,17
"Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.",Joey Tribbiani,1,5,13,18
"I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.",Monica Geller,1,5,13,20
"Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.",Joey Tribbiani,1,5,13,22

"Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh... ...hi.",Chandler Bing,1,6,2,24
"Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.",Chandler Bing,1,6,2,26
Whadja think?,Joey Tribbiani,1,6,2,30
"C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.",Joey Tribbiani,1,6,2,33
"She said yes!! She said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you.",Chandler Bing,1,6,2,35

"Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?",Monica Geller,1,6,3,5
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...,Chandler Bing,1,6,3,6
"Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.",Chandler Bing,1,6,3,9
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.,Chandler Bing,1,6,3,10
"Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?",Chandler Bing,1,6,3,12
Who's Rick?,Joey Tribbiani,1,6,3,14
Who's Rick?,Chandler Bing,1,6,3,15
"Oh, so you're divorced?",Chandler Bing,1,6,3,18
"Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?",Chandler Bing,1,6,3,20
"So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?",Chandler Bing,1,6,3,22
"Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?",Chandler Bing,1,6,3,24

...Hm.,Chandler Bing,1,6,3,29
Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.,Monica Geller,1,6,3,30
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?,Chandler Bing,1,6,3,31
"Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?",Monica Geller,1,6,3,32
"Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!",Chandler Bing,1,6,3,33
"Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?",Phoebe Buffay,1,6,3,34
"No, of course not! ...Yeah, yeah, it is.",Ross Geller,1,6,3,35
What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?,Monica Geller,1,6,3,36
I couldn't do it.,Joey Tribbiani,1,6,3,37
"Good for you, Joey.",Monica Geller,1,6,3,38
"When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.",Joey Tribbiani,1,6,3,39
"Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-",Ross Geller,1,6,3,40
"Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.",Ross Geller,1,6,3,42
"We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!",Monica Geller,1,6,3,43
"Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-",Ross Geller,1,6,3,45
Tah-daaah!,Rachel Green,1,6,4,1
Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.,Chandler Bing,1,6,4,2
"Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.",Rachel Green,1,6,4,3
"Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.",Ross Geller,1,6,4,4
"Well, whaddya think?",Rachel Green,1,6,4,5
...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.,Monica Geller,1,6,4,7
How-how did that happen?,Monica Geller,1,6,4,9
"I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.",Rachel Green,1,6,4,10
"Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.",Monica Geller,1,6,4,11
I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.,Phoebe Buffay,1,6,4,12
"Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.",Chandler Bing,1,6,4,13
"You guys, I am not that bad!",Monica Geller,1,6,4,14
"Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!",Phoebe Buffay,1,6,4,15
That is so unfair!,Monica Geller,1,6,4,16
"Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!",Ross Geller,1,6,4,17
"Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.",Monica Geller,1,6,4,18
"Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.",Ross Geller,1,6,4,19
Why not?,Monica Geller,1,6,4,20
Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.,Ross Geller,1,6,4,21
I could do that.,Monica Geller,1,6,4,22
"Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.",Rachel Green,1,6,4,23
Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.,Monica Geller,1,6,4,24
"Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...",Chandler Bing,1,6,4,25
STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?,Monica Geller,1,6,4,26
Monica? You're Mom.,Ross Geller,1,6,4,27
Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!,Phoebe Buffay,1,6,4,29

"Well, what's the part?",Monica Geller,1,6,4,33
"Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! ""I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!""",Joey Tribbiani,1,6,4,34

"Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!",Joey Tribbiani,1,6,4,44
"You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?",Ross Geller,1,6,4,45

"C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!",Chandler Bing,1,6,5,11
I warned you...,Monica Geller,1,6,5,12

"Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..",Chandler Bing,1,6,5,17
"Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?",Rachel Green,1,6,5,18
"No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?",Chandler Bing,1,6,5,19
"Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.",Monica Geller,1,6,5,20

I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...,Joey Tribbiani,1,6,6,14
"God, I love these fingers...",Chandler Bing,1,6,7,1
"No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.",Chandler Bing,1,6,7,3
"Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..",Chandler Bing,1,6,7,5

Lose the other guys.,Chandler Bing,1,6,7,25
"C'mon, we're great together, why not?",Chandler Bing,1,6,7,27
"...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'",Chandler Bing,1,6,7,29
"I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...",Chandler Bing,1,6,7,31
...The second guy.,Chandler Bing,1,6,7,33
"Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.",Chandler Bing,1,6,7,36
"Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?",Ross Geller,1,6,8,1
"Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?",Monica Geller,1,6,8,4
Nope.,Joey Tribbiani,1,6,8,5

"Hard to tell, I was naked.",Joey Tribbiani,1,6,8,18
"No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.",Phoebe Buffay,1,6,8,19
Yeah? That's so nice!,Joey Tribbiani,1,6,8,20
"I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.",Monica Geller,1,6,8,22
"Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?",Rachel Green,1,6,8,24
Uh-huh!,Monica Geller,1,6,8,25

"Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.",Monica Geller,1,6,8,27
She is a kook.,Ross Geller,1,6,8,28
"If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!",Monica Geller,1,6,9,1
"Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.",Rachel Green,1,7,1,1

"Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.",Ross Geller,1,7,8,28
Yeah right.,Rachel Green,1,7,8,29
"It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.",Ross Geller,1,7,8,30
OK.,Rachel Green,1,7,8,31

"No, you are not. We tell you stuff.",Monica Geller,1,7,10,31
Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.,Phoebe Buffay,1,7,10,32
Hmmm... this is so nice.,Rachel Green,1,7,11,1
"OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.",Ross Geller,1,7,11,2

Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?,Ross Geller,1,7,12,5
During a blackout? He'd get trampled!,Rachel Green,1,7,12,6
Yeah?,Ross Geller,1,7,12,7
"You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.",Chandler Bing,1,7,13,1
"Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?",Phoebe Buffay,1,7,14,1
Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.,Rachel Green,1,7,14,2
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?,Phoebe Buffay,1,7,14,4
Wait a minute. What's his name?,Phoebe Buffay,1,7,14,6

"Oh... Italy, I think.",Rachel Green,1,7,16,13
"No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.",Ross Geller,1,7,16,14
"Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!",Rachel Green,1,7,16,15
"That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.",Ross Geller,1,7,16,16
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.,Phoebe Buffay,1,7,16,18
"Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.",Rachel Green,1,7,16,19
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.,Phoebe Buffay,1,7,16,20
"Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.",Rachel Green,1,7,16,21
You betcha!,Phoebe Buffay,1,7,16,23

"Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.",Chandler Bing,1,7,17,3
"Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.",Chandler Bing,1,7,17,4
Yes... thank you. That was... that was....,Chandler Bing,1,7,17,9
"Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....",Ross Geller,1,7,18,2
Wha-What did he say that was so funny?,Ross Geller,1,7,18,4
I have absolutely no idea.,Rachel Green,1,7,18,5
That's... that's classic.,Ross Geller,1,7,18,6
"Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!",Rachel Green,1,7,18,7
"If you want, I'll do it.",Monica Geller,1,7,18,8
"I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.",Phoebe Buffay,1,7,18,10
"God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.",Rachel Green,1,7,18,11
"You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.",Phoebe Buffay,1,7,18,12

Paolo. Hi.,Ross Geller,1,7,18,15
"Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.",Ross Geller,1,7,18,18
"Thing, yes. Thing.",Ross Geller,1,7,18,20
"No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...",Ross Geller,1,7,18,22
"No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.",Ross Geller,1,7,18,24
Yeah! Se vice?,Ross Geller,1,7,18,26
So you do know a little English.,Ross Geller,1,7,18,28
Do you know the word crapweasel?,Ross Geller,1,7,18,30
"That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!",Ross Geller,1,7,18,32
OK.,Chandler Bing,1,7,19,2

Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?,Chandler Bing,1,8,1,1

Yes please.,Chandler Bing,1,8,1,5
He's a he?,Chandler Bing,1,8,1,7
"...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?",Chandler Bing,1,8,2,1
"Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...",Rachel Green,1,8,2,2
You did?,Chandler Bing,1,8,2,3
"Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.",Rachel Green,1,8,2,4
"Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?",Chandler Bing,1,8,2,5
I did.,Monica Geller,1,8,2,6
"Yeah, I think so, yeah.",Phoebe Buffay,1,8,2,7

You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?,Chandler Bing,1,8,2,10
"No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...",Ross Geller,1,8,2,11
"Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?",Chandler Bing,1,8,2,13
"I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...",Phoebe Buffay,1,8,2,14
"Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?",Chandler Bing,1,8,2,15

"Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.",Monica Geller,1,8,2,22

Nothing.,Monica Geller,1,8,3,7

"I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...",Ross Geller,1,8,4,10
Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.,Phoebe Buffay,1,8,4,11
"Nono, she's gone.",Ross Geller,1,8,4,12
We checked. A lot.,Monica Geller,1,8,4,13
"Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.",Phoebe Buffay,1,8,4,14
"Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?",Rachel Green,1,8,4,15
Thanks!,Phoebe Buffay,1,8,4,16
Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.,Rachel Green,1,8,4,17
"Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?",Joey Tribbiani,1,8,4,18
"Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.",Phoebe Buffay,1,8,4,19
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.,Ross Geller,1,8,5,1
I don't see why not.,Ross Geller,1,8,5,5
Here's my retainer!,Ross Geller,1,8,5,7
I was just thinking. When my time comes-,Ross Geller,1,8,6,1
Dad!,Monica Geller,1,8,6,2
"Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.",Ross Geller,1,8,6,3
You what?,Monica Geller,1,8,6,4
"I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.",Ross Geller,1,8,6,5
Define fun.,Monica Geller,1,8,6,6
"C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...",Ross Geller,1,8,6,7
"...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.",Monica Geller,1,8,6,8
"Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.",Ross Geller,1,8,6,9
That's probably what they'll say.,Monica Geller,1,8,6,10
I'd like that.,Ross Geller,1,8,6,11
"Hey, gorgeous.",Chandler Bing,1,8,7,1
"No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.",Chandler Bing,1,8,7,3

"No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.",Chandler Bing,1,8,7,13
Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.,Chandler Bing,1,8,7,15
This one?,Ross Geller,1,8,8,1
"I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.",Ross Geller,1,8,8,3
Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.,Ross Geller,1,8,8,6
"Okay. Um, how about these?",Ross Geller,1,8,8,9
And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?,Ross Geller,1,8,8,11
"Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.",Ross Geller,1,8,8,13
"No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.",Ross Geller,1,8,8,16
Oh my God..,Ross Geller,1,8,8,18
"Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.",Ross Geller,1,8,8,20
"How we doing, you guys ready?",Ross Geller,1,8,9,1
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?,Monica Geller,1,8,9,2
Some days it's all I can think about.,Ross Geller,1,8,9,3

"Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.",Joey Tribbiani,1,8,10,6
You're watching a football game at a funeral?,Chandler Bing,1,8,10,7

"Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.",Ross Geller,1,9,4,1

"I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.",Chandler Bing,1,9,4,3
"Hey, Rach, did you make your money?",Monica Geller,1,9,4,5

"Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.",Joey Tribbiani,1,9,8,15
That's not a question.,Monica Geller,1,9,8,16
"But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.",Joey Tribbiani,1,9,8,17
"All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.",Monica Geller,1,9,8,18

"Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.",Joey Tribbiani,1,9,12,3

Because!,Rachel Green,1,9,12,18
"Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...",Monica Geller,1,9,12,19

The bigger half.,Joey Tribbiani,1,9,12,51
"I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.",Chandler Bing,1,9,12,52

"Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...",Ross Geller,1,10,1,12
Why don't you just get a roommate?,Monica Geller,1,10,1,13

"Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?",Rachel Green,1,10,2,11
"Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!",Chandler Bing,1,10,2,12
"Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.",Rachel Green,1,10,2,13
"Yeah, you wish!",Phoebe Buffay,1,10,2,14

"Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?",Phoebe Buffay,1,10,2,30
"Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!",Phoebe Buffay,1,10,2,32
That guy's going home with a note!,Chandler Bing,1,10,2,33
Could you speak up please?,Phoebe Buffay,1,10,2,35

"Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.",Chandler Bing,1,10,3,28

"I know, I know, I'm sorry-",Rachel Green,1,19,6,2
"No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.",Ross Geller,1,19,6,3
"Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- Oh! Who is it?",Rachel Green,1,19,6,4

"We can't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.",Joey Tribbiani,1,19,6,68
"Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.",Chandler Bing,1,19,6,70

"Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there!

C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!",Rachel Green,1,19,7,28
"Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?",Rachel Green,1,19,7,30

That'd be good.,Rachel Green,1,19,8,6
"Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...",Ross Geller,1,19,8,7
Barry?!,Rachel Green,1,19,8,10

Eh. I thought that was an alp.,Chandler Bing,1,19,9,4
"Well, high school was not my favourite time.",Monica Geller,1,19,9,5
"I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.",Joey Tribbiani,1,19,9,6
"Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.",Chandler Bing,1,19,9,7
"Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?",Monica Geller,1,19,9,8
Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!,Phoebe Buffay,1,19,9,9
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.,Chandler Bing,1,20,1,1

"How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!",Phoebe Buffay,1,20,1,8
"I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...",Chandler Bing,1,20,2,1
So have you called her yet?,Monica Geller,1,20,2,2
"Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?",Chandler Bing,1,20,2,3
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.,Monica Geller,1,20,2,5
"Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!",Phoebe Buffay,1,20,2,6

"No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.",Chandler Bing,1,20,2,9
"So, uh, why didn't you say anything?",Phoebe Buffay,1,20,2,10
"Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase ""Yes indeedy-o.""",Chandler Bing,1,20,2,11
"Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!",Monica Geller,1,20,2,12
"Okay, okay, what's going on?",Ross Geller,1,20,2,13
"Okay, they're just talking...",Phoebe Buffay,1,20,2,14
"Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?",Ross Geller,1,20,2,15
"No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!",Phoebe Buffay,1,20,2,16

Hey Rach!,Chandler Bing,1,20,2,21
How'd it go?,Monica Geller,1,20,2,22
"Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...",Rachel Green,1,20,2,23
Not a good day for birds...,Phoebe Buffay,1,20,2,24
"Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...",Rachel Green,1,20,2,25
"That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?",Ross Geller,1,20,2,26
"Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!",Rachel Green,1,20,2,27
"That's, that's nice twice!",Ross Geller,1,20,2,28

"Duh, where've you been?",Joey Tribbiani,1,20,2,30
"Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?",Rachel Green,1,20,2,31
Yes!,Chandler Bing,1,20,2,33
Why?,Rachel Green,1,20,2,34
I have my reasons.,Chandler Bing,1,20,2,35
"Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?",Monica Geller,1,20,2,36

"Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!",Chandler Bing,1,20,4,1
That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!,Monica Geller,1,20,4,2
"Hey, I've been honing!",Chandler Bing,1,20,4,3
What was with the dishes?,Ross Geller,1,20,4,4
"Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.",Chandler Bing,1,20,4,5
"Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!",Monica Geller,1,20,4,6
Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!,Phoebe Buffay,1,20,4,7
"Great, now he's waving back.",Monica Geller,1,20,4,8
"Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!",Joey Tribbiani,1,20,4,9
What kinda stuff?,Monica Geller,1,20,4,10
"Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.",Joey Tribbiani,1,20,4,11
You cook naked?,Phoebe Buffay,1,20,4,12
"Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.",Joey Tribbiani,1,20,4,13

"Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.",Monica Geller,1,20,6,2
"Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?",Chandler Bing,1,20,6,4
Maybe she never got your message.,Joey Tribbiani,1,20,6,5
"Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.",Phoebe Buffay,1,20,6,6
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...,Chandler Bing,1,20,6,7
"...desperate, needy, pathetic?",Ross Geller,1,20,6,8
"Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.",Chandler Bing,1,20,6,9
How many beeps?,Phoebe Buffay,1,20,6,11
She answered.,Chandler Bing,1,20,6,12
"Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.",Monica Geller,1,20,6,13
"I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.",Chandler Bing,1,20,6,14
How'd he take it?,Phoebe Buffay,1,20,6,17
"Pretty well, actually...",Rachel Green,1,20,6,18

"No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!",Ross Geller,1,20,6,28
"Please. If she said to you, ""Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now,"" what would you say?",Rachel Green,1,20,6,29
"If it helps, I could slide over.",Chandler Bing,1,20,6,31
"It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.",Ross Geller,1,20,6,32
Where are you going?,Phoebe Buffay,1,20,6,33

"Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.",Monica Geller,1,20,7,10

"Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?",Chandler Bing,1,20,7,18
Why don't you just take it with you?,Monica Geller,1,20,7,19

"No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back.

"Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.",Rachel Green,1,20,10,15
"Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.",Rachel Green,1,20,10,21
"What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!",Rachel Green,1,20,10,23

How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?,Joey Tribbiani,1,21,1,1
I have no idea. But look how much they spent!,Monica Geller,1,21,1,2
"Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.",Rachel Green,1,21,1,3
I know. It's just such reckless spending.,Monica Geller,1,21,1,4
"I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.",Ross Geller,1,21,1,5
"Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.",Chandler Bing,1,21,1,6

"She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.",Monica Geller,1,21,2,4

At the vet.,Ross Geller,1,21,6,4
"She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?",Chandler Bing,1,21,6,5
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.,Ross Geller,1,21,6,6

Isn't there any way you can keep him?,Joey Tribbiani,1,21,7,4
"No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.",Ross Geller,1,21,7,5
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?,Joey Tribbiani,1,21,7,6
"I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.",Chandler Bing,1,21,7,7
"Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.",Ross Geller,1,21,7,8
"Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.",Chandler Bing,1,21,7,9
"Hey. We found her, we found the girl.",Phoebe Buffay,1,21,7,11

Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.,Phoebe Buffay,1,21,7,20
No way. No way did you do this.,Rachel Green,1,21,8,1

...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!,Monica Geller,1,21,8,5

"Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?",Chandler Bing,1,24,2,96

"Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.",Joey Tribbiani,1,24,3,8
"Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.",Rachel Green,1,24,3,9

"Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?",Monica Geller,1,24,3,16
I-I-I don't know.,Rachel Green,1,24,3,17
Well then maybe you shouldn't go.,Chandler Bing,1,24,3,18
"He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.",Joey Tribbiani,1,24,3,19
"Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.",Monica Geller,1,24,3,20
I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.,Rachel Green,1,24,3,21
"Here, look, alright, does this help?",Phoebe Buffay,1,24,3,22
"Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.",Rachel Green,1,24,3,24

Sure! Why not?,Joey Tribbiani,1,24,5,6
How do you mean?,Joey Tribbiani,1,24,5,10
"Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?",Monica Geller,1,24,6,1
"I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.",Rachel Green,1,24,6,2
"I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.",Rachel Green,1,24,6,4
"Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!",Monica Geller,1,24,6,5
"Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.",Phoebe Buffay,1,24,6,6
Another good point.,Monica Geller,1,24,6,7

Huh?,Rachel Green,1,24,6,9
"Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?",Phoebe Buffay,1,24,6,10
Why isn't it working out?,Monica Geller,1,24,6,11
I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.,Rachel Green,1,24,6,12
Is he not cute enough for you?,Monica Geller,1,24,6,13
No!,Rachel Green,1,24,6,14
Does he not make enough money?,Monica Geller,1,24,6,15
"No, I'm just....",Rachel Green,1,24,6,16
Maybe there's someone else.,Phoebe Buffay,1,24,6,17
Wha...,Rachel Green,1,24,6,18
Is there? Is there someone else?,Monica Geller,1,24,6,19

So how'd it go?,Chandler Bing,1,24,7,5
"Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?",Joey Tribbiani,1,24,7,6
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.,Chandler Bing,1,24,7,7
"Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!",Joey Tribbiani,1,24,7,8
"Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.",Chandler Bing,1,24,7,9
"It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.",Joey Tribbiani,1,24,7,10
I didn't know you had another level.,Chandler Bing,1,24,7,11

"Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.",Rachel Green,1,24,8,6
"Oh, why?",Monica Geller,1,24,8,7
"Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...",Rachel Green,1,24,8,8
"No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!",Monica Geller,1,24,8,9

"Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?",Chandler Bing,1,24,9,2
"Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.",Joey Tribbiani,1,24,9,3
"Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?",Chandler Bing,1,24,9,4
"What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?",Joey Tribbiani,1,24,9,5
I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.,Ross Geller,1,24,10,3
"Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.",Rachel Green,1,24,10,4
"Fine, just stop thinking about me.",Ross Geller,1,24,10,5
"Can't do it, can you?",Ross Geller,1,24,10,7
So I'm thinking about you. So what?,Rachel Green,1,24,10,8
"I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?",Ross Geller,1,24,10,9

"Ross, it's too hard.",Rachel Green,1,24,10,13

"If we broke up, and I lost you...",Rachel Green,1,24,10,17
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?",Ross Geller,1,24,10,18
"Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?",Rachel Green,1,24,10,19
"No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?",Ross Geller,1,24,10,20
"I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.",Rachel Green,1,24,10,21
"Well, start looking.",Ross Geller,1,24,10,22

"No, no, they will. I just... uh...",Ross Geller,1,24,11,12
"Come on, they're gonna love you.",Ross Geller,1,24,11,14
"Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like ""forget about her"" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, ""Oh my god."" So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?",Phoebe Buffay,2,1,1,2
Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!,Rachel Green,2,1,2,2

"Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.",Ross Geller,2,1,2,9
"These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.",Rachel Green,2,1,2,10
"Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.",Rachel Green,2,1,2,12
No way!,Chandler Bing,2,1,3,2
"I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!",Monica Geller,2,1,3,3

"You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!",Rachel Green,2,1,3,12
"That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?",Ross Geller,2,1,3,13

And bus.,Ross Geller,2,1,3,19
The screaming guy?,Ross Geller,2,1,3,21
You gotta hear this story.,Ross Geller,2,1,3,23
200 at least.,Ross Geller,2,1,3,25
"And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.",Rachel Green,2,1,3,27
"This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?",Monica Geller,2,1,3,28
"But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.",Ross Geller,2,1,3,30
"Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?",Rachel Green,2,1,3,31
It's an expression.,Monica Geller,2,1,3,32
"Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.",Ross Geller,2,1,3,33
"Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.",Ross Geller,2,1,3,35
"Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.",Chandler Bing,2,1,3,36

Did you talk to him?,Rachel Green,2,1,4,6
Not yet.,Chandler Bing,2,1,4,7
"Then, no.",Rachel Green,2,1,4,8
"So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.",Chandler Bing,2,1,4,9
"I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?",Ross Geller,2,1,4,10
God?,Chandler Bing,2,1,4,11
"It was you, pal.",Ross Geller,2,1,4,12
"Well, maybe it was God, doing me.",Chandler Bing,2,1,4,13
"Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.",Ross Geller,2,1,4,14
"Well, you owe me one, big guy.",Chandler Bing,2,1,4,15
Here's your lemonade.,Rachel Green,2,1,4,16

But...,Ross Geller,2,1,4,19
"Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?",Rachel Green,2,1,4,20
"He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever.",Chandler Bing,2,1,4,21
How is that the silver lining?,Rachel Green,2,1,4,22
You have to really wanna see it.,Chandler Bing,2,1,4,23
"Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.",Ross Geller,2,1,5,2
"Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?",Monica Geller,2,1,5,3
"Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?",Phoebe Buffay,2,1,5,4
"No, although now that's what I'm thinking.",Monica Geller,2,1,5,5
"All right, so what were you thinking?",Phoebe Buffay,2,1,5,6
"Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?",Monica Geller,2,1,5,7
Ohh! No.,Phoebe Buffay,2,1,5,8
Why not?,Monica Geller,2,1,5,9
"Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.",Phoebe Buffay,2,1,5,10

That is not true!,Monica Geller,2,2,8,24
"Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?",Rachel Green,2,2,8,25
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?,Monica Geller,2,2,8,26

Yes.,Rachel Green,2,2,11,7
It's that terrible?,Monica Geller,2,2,11,8

"Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.",Monica Geller,2,2,11,10
I love you too.,Rachel Green,2,2,11,11
"You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.",Phoebe Buffay,2,2,11,12
"Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out.

"So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?",Rachel Green,2,2,13,3
Really? Me?,Rachel Green,2,2,13,5
"Well, you're not totally paranoid.",Rachel Green,2,2,13,7
"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.",Rachel Green,2,2,13,9

"Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.",Monica Geller,2,3,11,36

Wow.,Joey Tribbiani,2,7,10,15
"Yeah, so I said, ""OK, relax please,"" y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.",Phoebe Buffay,2,7,10,16

And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.,Chandler Bing,2,7,12,12
"Well no, but um.",Monica Geller,2,7,12,13
"I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.",Chandler Bing,2,7,12,14
"Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .",Monica Geller,2,7,12,15
"So, you feel like goin' for a run?",Chandler Bing,2,7,12,16

"No, Amish boy.",Chandler Bing,2,8,6,9
"Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.",Joey Tribbiani,2,8,6,10
"I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.",Ross Geller,2,8,6,11
You could say that.,Joey Tribbiani,2,8,6,12
"And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.",Ross Geller,2,8,6,13

"Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?",Joey Tribbiani,2,8,8,3
"Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.",Ross Geller,2,8,8,4

"No, you don't.",Ross Geller,2,8,8,39
"All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it.",Rachel Green,2,8,8,40
"What is this? Ross, what is this?",Rachel Green,2,8,8,41
Good luck.,Chandler Bing,2,8,8,42
"Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?",Ross Geller,2,8,8,43

"Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.",Ross Geller,2,8,10,20
"No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.",Rachel Green,2,8,10,21
"No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.",Ross Geller,2,8,10,22
"Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!",Rachel Green,2,8,10,23
"You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.",Ross Geller,2,8,10,24
"Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.",Rachel Green,2,8,10,25
"I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer.",Joey Tribbiani,2,8,10,26
"Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.",Monica Geller,2,8,11,2

"Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.",Monica Geller,2,8,11,6

"Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.",Monica Geller,2,9,1,8
And twenty-five it is.,Chandler Bing,2,9,1,9
You gave him cookies?,Joey Tribbiani,2,9,1,10
"Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.",Monica Geller,2,9,1,11
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.,Phoebe Buffay,2,9,1,12
"Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?",Chandler Bing,2,9,1,13
"Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.",Phoebe Buffay,2,9,1,14

Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.,Chandler Bing,2,9,2,3

Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?,Rachel Green,2,9,2,7
"How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?",Ross Geller,2,9,2,8

Oh.,Phoebe Buffay,2,9,3,22
Oh.,Phoebe Buffay,2,9,3,24
"Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.",Chandler Bing,2,9,4,2

Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?,Monica Geller,2,10,4,18
"OK, OK, don't get all squinky.",Phoebe Buffay,2,10,4,19
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.,Rachel Green,2,10,4,20
"But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.",Monica Geller,2,10,4,21
"Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.",Phoebe Buffay,2,10,4,22
Hey Ross.... bahhhh!,Chandler Bing,2,10,4,24

"Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?",Chandler Bing,2,10,4,68
What do you mean?,Ross Geller,2,10,4,69
Do you not see it?,Monica Geller,2,10,4,70
"See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.",Ross Geller,2,10,4,71
"Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?",Chandler Bing,2,10,4,72
....................Yeah.,Ross Geller,2,10,4,73
Hey.,Chandler Bing,2,10,5,2
Hey.,Joey Tribbiani,2,10,5,3
"Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.",Chandler Bing,2,10,5,4

"So, what're you gonna do?",Chandler Bing,2,10,5,10

"Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.",Chandler Bing,2,10,5,12
I've never slept with someone for a part.,Joey Tribbiani,2,10,5,13
Well is she...,Chandler Bing,2,10,5,14
Sorry.,Joey Tribbiani,2,10,5,15
It's alright. Is she good-looking?,Chandler Bing,2,10,5,16
"Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her.",Joey Tribbiani,2,10,5,17
"Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.",Chandler Bing,2,10,5,18
"I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.",Joey Tribbiani,2,10,5,19
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?,Chandler Bing,2,10,5,20
"Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.",Joey Tribbiani,2,10,5,21
"Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you.",Monica Geller,2,10,6,3
"No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.",Monica Geller,2,10,6,5
I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.,Monica Geller,2,10,6,7
"Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.",Chandler Bing,2,10,7,2
Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.,Ross Geller,2,10,7,4
"And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues.",Chandler Bing,2,10,7,5
You don't see it? You actually don't see it?,Phoebe Buffay,2,10,7,6
What?,Rachel Green,2,10,7,7
"OK honey, you're dating Ross.",Phoebe Buffay,2,10,7,8
"No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.",Rachel Green,2,10,7,9
Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!,Phoebe Buffay,2,10,7,10
Steve... sleeve!,Rachel Green,2,10,7,11
"OK, noone is named Sleeve.",Phoebe Buffay,2,10,7,12
"Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.",Rachel Green,2,10,7,13
"For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.",Ross Geller,2,10,7,14
"OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.",Chandler Bing,2,10,7,16
"Oh you do, do you?",Ross Geller,2,10,7,18
Of... of what?,Ross Geller,2,10,7,20
"Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.",Ross Geller,2,10,7,22
"No, no, let me finish.",Ross Geller,2,10,7,24
"No, you let me fini...",Ross Geller,2,10,7,26
Hi.,Ross Geller,2,10,7,27
"Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww!",Rachel Green,2,10,7,29
Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?,Rachel Green,2,10,8,2
"No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?",Chandler Bing,2,10,8,3
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?,Rachel Green,2,10,8,4
Me.,Chandler Bing,2,10,8,5
Why would I have to sleep with you?,Rachel Green,2,10,8,6
It's my game. You want the job or not?,Chandler Bing,2,10,8,7
Hey.,Chandler Bing,2,10,8,8

"Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?",Monica Geller,2,10,8,11
Ooooohhhh.,Ross Geller,2,10,8,12
What's with all the bottles of liquor?,Phoebe Buffay,2,10,8,13
"What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?",Ross Geller,2,10,8,14
"Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.",Monica Geller,2,10,8,15
"Oh God, even his knock is boring.",Rachel Green,2,10,8,16
Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.,Monica Geller,2,10,8,17

"What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.",Monica Geller,2,10,8,25
Oh... shoot.,Monica Geller,2,10,8,27
OK.,Monica Geller,2,10,8,29
Take care.,Monica Geller,2,10,8,30
What happened?,Rachel Green,2,10,8,32
Well we... we kinda broke up.,Monica Geller,2,10,8,33
Does anybody want these?,Monica Geller,2,10,8,35
I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.,Chandler Bing,2,10,8,36
Hey.,Joey Tribbiani,2,10,8,37
How'd the callback go?,Ross Geller,2,10,8,39
It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.,Joey Tribbiani,2,10,8,40
So what'd you do?,Chandler Bing,2,10,8,41
"Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.",Joey Tribbiani,2,10,8,42
Good for you.,Ross Geller,2,10,8,43
"But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.",Joey Tribbiani,2,10,8,44
So... and?,Phoebe Buffay,2,10,8,45
"Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!",Joey Tribbiani,2,10,8,46
Alright... I've got to go shower.,Joey Tribbiani,2,10,8,48
"Oh, hey.",Chandler Bing,2,10,9,3
Hi.,Phoebe Buffay,2,10,9,4
"Yeah, I'm sorry man.",Chandler Bing,2,10,9,6
"Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.",Phoebe Buffay,2,10,9,8
Hey!,Chandler Bing,2,10,9,11
"Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?",Phoebe Buffay,2,10,9,12
"Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!",Ross Geller,2,11,1,2
"Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.",Ross Geller,2,11,1,4
Ok.,Ross Geller,2,11,1,6
"Oh, you and me?",Ross Geller,2,11,1,9
Ok.,Ross Geller,2,11,1,12
"As in, ""I now pronounce you wife and wife"" married?",Ross Geller,2,11,1,14
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.,Ross Geller,2,11,1,16
"No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!",Ross Geller,2,11,1,18
Mmm hmmm.,Ross Geller,2,11,1,20
Uh-huh.,Ross Geller,2,11,1,22
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.,Ross Geller,2,11,2,2
"It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..",Joey Tribbiani,2,11,2,3
"Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.",Monica Geller,2,11,2,4
"They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?",Monica Geller,2,11,2,6
Would it matter?,Ross Geller,2,11,2,7
"Oh, you are so great! Thank you!",Monica Geller,2,11,2,8
Are you really not going?,Joey Tribbiani,2,11,2,9
"I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?",Ross Geller,2,11,2,10
"They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.",Monica Geller,2,11,2,11
If you wanna call that a reason.,Ross Geller,2,11,2,12
"Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.",Chandler Bing,2,11,2,13
"Ross, I thought you were over this.",Monica Geller,2,11,2,14
"Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.",Ross Geller,2,11,2,15
"Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.",Joey Tribbiani,2,11,2,16
Did I miss it? Did I miss it?,Rachel Green,2,11,2,17
"No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.",Joey Tribbiani,2,11,2,18
"Whoa, she's pretty.",Chandler Bing,2,11,2,19
"Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.",Joey Tribbiani,2,11,2,20
"I'm sorry, what?",Rachel Green,2,11,2,21
What?,Monica Geller,2,11,2,22
"It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.",Joey Tribbiani,2,11,2,23
"Oh, ok.",Chandler Bing,2,11,2,24
"There's my scene, there's my scene. ""Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.",Joey Tribbiani,2,11,2,25
I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.,Joey Tribbiani,2,11,2,27
Nice!,Chandler Bing,2,11,2,28
That's great!,Rachel Green,2,11,2,29
Excellent!,Ross Geller,2,11,2,30
For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.,Chandler Bing,2,11,2,31
That is so good! Do it again!,Ross Geller,2,11,3,2
"All right, all right. ""Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!""",Joey Tribbiani,2,11,3,3
"That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.",Chandler Bing,2,11,3,4
"No no, that's me.",Ross Geller,2,11,3,5
"Oh, yeah.",Chandler Bing,2,11,3,6
"Oh, hello.",Ross Geller,2,11,3,7
"Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...",Phoebe Buffay,2,11,3,8
Is everything ok?,Ross Geller,2,11,3,9
"Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.",Phoebe Buffay,2,11,3,10
Oh my god.,Ross Geller,2,11,3,11
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.,Chandler Bing,2,11,3,12
"Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.",Phoebe Buffay,2,11,3,13
"Oh, honey.",Monica Geller,2,11,3,14
"Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, ""ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage."" Little did she know God was thinking, ""Ok, but that's it."" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.",Phoebe Buffay,2,11,3,15
What do you mean?,Rachel Green,2,11,3,16
I think it went into me.,Phoebe Buffay,2,11,3,17
"God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.",Monica Geller,2,11,4,2
"Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.",Chandler Bing,2,11,4,3
"Ok, who ordered what?",Rachel Green,2,11,4,4
"Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.",Ross Geller,2,11,4,5
"Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?",Chandler Bing,2,11,4,6
Oh god.,Rachel Green,2,11,4,7
I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.,Joey Tribbiani,2,11,4,8
"I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?",Rachel Green,2,11,4,9
Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.,Phoebe Buffay,2,11,4,10
"Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?",Joey Tribbiani,2,11,4,11
"I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!",Phoebe Buffay,2,11,4,12
Mom!,Rachel Green,2,11,4,14
Pretty much.,Rachel Green,2,11,4,16
"This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.",Rachel Green,2,11,4,18
"Hi, Mrs. Green.",Ross Geller,2,11,4,20
Oh Mom!,Rachel Green,2,11,4,22
"Believe me, sometimes that happens.",Chandler Bing,2,11,4,24
Really?,Rachel Green,2,11,4,26
"I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.",Phoebe Buffay,2,11,4,28
"Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?",Joey Tribbiani,2,11,4,29
I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?,Phoebe Buffay,2,11,4,30
"Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.",Rachel Green,2,11,5,3
"I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?",Rachel Green,2,11,5,5
For...me.,Rachel Green,2,11,5,7
"Well, what do you mean?",Rachel Green,2,11,5,9
"All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.",Monica Geller,2,11,5,11
Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.,Rachel Green,2,11,5,12
Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.,Monica Geller,2,11,5,13
And you had no idea they weren't getting along?,Ross Geller,2,11,5,14
None.,Rachel Green,2,11,5,15
They didn't fight a lot?,Joey Tribbiani,2,11,5,16
"No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?",Rachel Green,2,11,5,17
"In my day, divorce was not an option.",Phoebe Buffay,2,11,5,18
"Hey, look who's up.",Joey Tribbiani,2,11,5,19
"I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.",Rachel Green,2,11,5,20
"Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.",Monica Geller,2,11,5,21
"Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?",Rachel Green,2,11,5,22
"You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.",Chandler Bing,2,11,5,23

"Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.",Chandler Bing,2,16,1,10
"Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?",Joey Tribbiani,2,16,1,11
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.,Chandler Bing,2,16,1,12
"Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.",Joey Tribbiani,2,16,1,13

"Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?",Rachel Green,2,16,2,21
"No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?",Ross Geller,2,16,2,22

"No, I think you should tell them.",Phoebe Buffay,2,16,2,28
"No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.",Monica Geller,2,16,2,29
"I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'",Ross Geller,2,16,2,30
"Alright, shall we?",Ross Geller,2,16,3,2
"OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.",Monica Geller,2,16,3,3

"I know, this is a great apartment.",Chandler Bing,2,16,5,3
"Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.",Joey Tribbiani,2,16,5,4
"Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.",Chandler Bing,2,16,5,5
"Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.",Joey Tribbiani,2,16,5,7

"Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?",Ross Geller,2,16,6,7

Well I. . .,Rachel Green,2,16,7,3

Here we go.,Phoebe Buffay,2,16,7,6
Uh-huh.,Rachel Green,2,16,7,7
You're not going?,Phoebe Buffay,2,16,7,8
Uh-huh.,Rachel Green,2,16,7,9
What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?,Phoebe Buffay,2,16,7,10

"I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?",Phoebe Buffay,2,16,7,12
What's 1922?,Rachel Green,2,16,7,13
"Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?",Phoebe Buffay,2,16,7,14
"Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .",Rachel Green,2,16,7,15

"Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.",Ross Geller,2,16,8,14
I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.,Ross Geller,2,16,8,16
"Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.",Ross Geller,2,16,8,18
"I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.",Ross Geller,2,16,8,20
Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.,Ross Geller,2,16,8,22
"C'mon, it's my birthday.",Ross Geller,2,16,8,24

"Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.",Chandler Bing,2,16,9,9
"What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.",Joey Tribbiani,2,16,9,10
"Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.",Chandler Bing,2,16,9,11
Well that's how I feel.,Joey Tribbiani,2,16,9,12
Well then maybe you should take it.,Chandler Bing,2,16,9,13

So what're you gonna do?,Monica Geller,2,17,13,10
"Well, I can't work with people who would do this.",Phoebe Buffay,2,17,13,11

"OK, Phoebs. But what about you?",Rachel Green,2,17,13,16
"Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels.",Phoebe Buffay,2,17,13,17

God that is good TV.,Chandler Bing,2,18,1,12
"Phoebs, play with meeee.",Chandler Bing,2,18,2,2

"Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.",Chandler Bing,2,18,2,4
Why don't you play with your roommate?,Phoebe Buffay,2,18,2,5
"Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.",Chandler Bing,2,18,2,6
"Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?",Phoebe Buffay,2,18,2,7
"No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.",Chandler Bing,2,18,2,8
"Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?",Phoebe Buffay,2,18,2,9
We don't need to remedy that.,Chandler Bing,2,18,2,10
"Oh yeah, it'll be fun.",Phoebe Buffay,2,18,2,11
"Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.",Phoebe Buffay,2,18,2,13

"Ooh, I look good.",Joey Tribbiani,2,18,6,6
"Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?",Phoebe Buffay,2,18,6,7
"Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'",Joey Tribbiani,2,18,6,8
"Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?",Phoebe Buffay,2,18,6,9
"Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?",Joey Tribbiani,2,18,6,10
"I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?",Joey Tribbiani,2,18,8,2

"No. No way, I'm not signing that.",Joey Tribbiani,2,18,8,6
How can they do this to me?,Joey Tribbiani,2,18,8,8
"Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.",Monica Geller,2,18,9,2
"Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.",Rachel Green,2,18,9,3
G'night.,Ross Geller,2,18,9,4

Really?,Ross Geller,2,18,9,22
"Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.",Rachel Green,2,18,9,23
"Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.",Chandler Bing,2,18,10,2
"This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.",Chandler Bing,2,18,10,4
Buddy?,Chandler Bing,2,18,10,6
There was no fish when she dropped it off.,Chandler Bing,2,18,10,8
Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?,Chandler Bing,2,18,10,10

"Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.",Ross Geller,2,18,11,18
"God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...",Rachel Green,2,18,11,19
"Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?",Ross Geller,2,18,11,20
"Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.",Rachel Green,2,18,11,21
Knock-knock.,Ross Geller,2,18,11,22

"It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?",Monica Geller,2,20,7,32

"Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?",Monica Geller,2,20,8,5
"I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, ""It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does.""",Phoebe Buffay,2,20,8,6

What's the matter?,Rachel Green,2,21,6,4
"I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.",Phoebe Buffay,2,21,6,5

"Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?",Monica Geller,2,21,7,5
"Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.",Joey Tribbiani,2,21,7,6
How did you make $17.,Rachel Green,2,21,7,7
"Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.",Monica Geller,2,21,7,8
How come those?,Joey Tribbiani,2,21,7,9
"Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.",Monica Geller,2,21,7,10

Good.,Joey Tribbiani,2,21,7,17

"Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.",Phoebe Buffay,2,21,7,19
"Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?",Rachel Green,2,21,7,20
"I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'",Phoebe Buffay,2,21,7,21
"Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.",Joey Tribbiani,2,21,7,22
"Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok.",Phoebe Buffay,2,21,7,23
DON'T...be too long with the phone.,Monica Geller,2,21,7,24
She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.,Rachel Green,2,21,7,25
It's a woman.,Joey Tribbiani,2,21,7,26
So talk to her.,Phoebe Buffay,2,21,7,27
"Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye.",Joey Tribbiani,2,21,7,28
Why the voice.,Rachel Green,2,21,7,29

Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.,Chandler Bing,2,21,8,4
Absolutely.,Ross Geller,2,21,8,5
How come it's not mixing with the water?,Ross Geller,2,21,8,6
"Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.",Chandler Bing,2,21,8,7
"Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.",Joey Tribbiani,2,21,8,8
Ok.,Chandler Bing,2,21,8,9
No.,Ross Geller,2,21,8,10
No?,Chandler Bing,2,21,8,11
"No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.",Ross Geller,2,21,8,12
"Alright, hang on a second there Custer.",Chandler Bing,2,21,8,13
"Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?",Joey Tribbiani,2,21,8,14
"Yeah, sure.",Ross Geller,2,21,8,15
By someone besides Monica?,Joey Tribbiani,2,21,8,16
"No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.",Ross Geller,2,21,8,17
"Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back.",Chandler Bing,2,21,8,18

"Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?",Monica Geller,2,21,9,12
"I, I don't have it.",Rachel Green,2,21,9,13
"But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.",Monica Geller,2,21,9,14
Nobody does honey.,Rachel Green,2,21,9,15

Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?,Ross Geller,2,22,1,5
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?,Monica Geller,2,22,1,6
Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?,Ross Geller,2,22,1,7
Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?,Joey Tribbiani,2,22,1,8

"Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.",Monica Geller,2,22,1,11

"Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.",Joey Tribbiani,2,22,2,4
Why not her?,Phoebe Buffay,2,22,2,5
"Cause she uh, she steals stuff.",Joey Tribbiani,2,22,2,6
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.,Chandler Bing,2,22,2,7
Joey that is horriable.,Monica Geller,2,22,2,8
"Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.",Joey Tribbiani,2,22,2,9

"Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.",Chandler Bing,2,22,2,14
"Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.",Rachel Green,2,22,2,15
So what happened?,Monica Geller,2,22,2,16
"My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.",Rachel Green,2,22,2,17
"Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.",Phoebe Buffay,2,22,2,18
"Well, how bout just her mom?",Monica Geller,2,22,2,19
Why her mom?,Chandler Bing,2,22,2,20
Cause I already invited her.,Monica Geller,2,22,2,21

It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.,Monica Geller,2,22,3,5
"Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.",Joey Tribbiani,2,22,3,6
Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?,Monica Geller,2,22,3,7
"No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.",Monica Geller,2,22,3,9
"No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.",Monica Geller,2,22,3,11
"This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?",Chandler Bing,2,22,3,13
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.,Monica Geller,2,22,3,15
"So, basically just a Chinese guy.",Chandler Bing,2,22,3,16
"Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.",Joey Tribbiani,2,22,3,17
"Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.",Monica Geller,2,22,3,20
"Yes because uh, you look so young.",Chandler Bing,2,22,3,22
"And because you're both, you know, white women.",Phoebe Buffay,2,22,3,23
"NO! No, I'll take that for ya.",Chandler Bing,2,22,3,25
"Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.",Phoebe Buffay,2,22,3,27
"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.",Monica Geller,2,22,3,28
"Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?",Chandler Bing,2,22,3,29
"Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.",Joey Tribbiani,2,22,3,30
"So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.",Monica Geller,2,22,3,31
"Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?",Chandler Bing,2,22,3,32
Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.,Monica Geller,2,22,3,33
Right this is staging.,Joey Tribbiani,2,22,3,34
"Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.",Chandler Bing,2,22,3,35
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.,Joey Tribbiani,2,22,3,36
"Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.",Chandler Bing,2,22,4,2

All right.,Ross Geller,2,22,4,16
"Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.",Monica Geller,2,22,4,17

"This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?",Rachel Green,2,22,6,3

"Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.",Rachel Green,2,22,6,5
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?,Chandler Bing,2,22,6,6
"It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...",Rachel Green,2,22,6,7

"Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.",Monica Geller,2,23,1,13
"Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.",Phoebe Buffay,2,23,1,14
You went out with a guy in the Navy?,Rachel Green,2,23,1,15

"Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?",Joey Tribbiani,2,23,1,17

"Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!",Phoebe Buffay,2,23,1,30
"Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.",Monica Geller,2,23,2,2
Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.,Monica Geller,2,23,2,5
Just waiting for you sweetie.,Monica Geller,2,23,2,7
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.",Monica Geller,2,23,2,9

"Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.",Monica Geller,2,23,2,13
I'm just easing you in.,Monica Geller,2,23,2,15
"Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.",Monica Geller,2,23,2,17
"Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.",Monica Geller,2,23,2,19
"Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.",Chandler Bing,2,23,3,2
But don't you need experience for a job like that?,Joey Tribbiani,2,23,3,3
"It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.",Chandler Bing,2,23,3,4
"Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.",Chandler Bing,2,23,3,6
"Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.",Joey Tribbiani,2,23,3,8

"Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.",Phoebe Buffay,2,23,5,22
Hey.,Joey Tribbiani,2,23,6,2
"Hey, how's the first day goin'?",Chandler Bing,2,23,6,3

"Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.",Joey Tribbiani,2,23,6,6

Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.,Chandler Bing,2,23,6,11
"Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.",Joey Tribbiani,2,23,6,12
"Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.",Chandler Bing,2,23,6,13
"Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.",Joey Tribbiani,2,23,6,14

"No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes.",Phoebe Buffay,2,23,7,11
"Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.",Phoebe Buffay,2,23,7,13
Give it.,Phoebe Buffay,2,23,7,15
"Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good.",Phoebe Buffay,2,23,7,17
"Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.",Phoebe Buffay,2,23,7,19
"Oh, stop that, stop that right now.",Rachel Green,2,23,7,20
"You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.",Ross Geller,2,23,7,21
"You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.",Joey Tribbiani,2,23,8,2
"Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.",Joey Tribbiani,2,23,8,4
What a phony.,Joey Tribbiani,2,23,8,6

Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.,Chandler Bing,2,23,8,10
"Yeah Bing, what's that about?",Joey Tribbiani,2,23,8,12
"It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.",Chandler Bing,2,23,8,13
This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.,Joey Tribbiani,2,23,8,15
"Uh, if you say so sir.",Chandler Bing,2,23,8,17
"Joseph's good, isn't he?",Joey Tribbiani,2,23,8,18
"Well, I'm going to kill you.",Chandler Bing,2,23,8,19
"Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.",Joey Tribbiani,2,23,8,20
Why?,Chandler Bing,2,23,8,21
"Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.",Joey Tribbiani,2,23,8,22
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.,Monica Geller,2,23,9,3

Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.,Joey Tribbiani,2,23,10,2
Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?,Chandler Bing,2,23,10,3
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.,Joey Tribbiani,2,23,10,4
"Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?",Chandler Bing,2,23,10,5
"Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.",Joey Tribbiani,2,23,10,6
"Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.",Chandler Bing,2,23,10,7
"What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.",Joey Tribbiani,2,23,10,8
"I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.",Chandler Bing,2,23,10,9
"Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.",Joey Tribbiani,2,23,10,10
"Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.",Chandler Bing,2,23,10,11

Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.,Joey Tribbiani,2,23,10,14
"Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.",Chandler Bing,2,23,10,15
Really?,Joey Tribbiani,2,23,10,16
"No freakshow, she's fictional.",Chandler Bing,2,23,10,17
"Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.",Joey Tribbiani,2,23,10,18

"Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....",Chandler Bing,3,3,4,21

"Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.",Chandler Bing,3,3,4,30

"Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.",Ross Geller,3,3,5,11

He's got the body for it.,Joey Tribbiani,3,3,11,20

"Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?",Ross Geller,3,3,12,8
Sure. What's up?,Chandler Bing,3,3,12,9
"Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!",Ross Geller,3,3,12,10
"Oh, oh! It's on again!",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,1,3
"You guys, can we please not watch this all right.",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,1,4
"Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,1,7

Hey!,Joey Tribbiani,3,4,2,5
Hey.,Phoebe Buffay,3,4,2,6
"Hey, man. What's up?",Chandler Bing,3,4,2,7
Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!,Joey Tribbiani,3,4,2,8
"Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.",Chandler Bing,3,4,2,9
"Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,2,10
How is it you?,Joey Tribbiani,3,4,2,11
"Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,2,12
"Yep, that's my audition.",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,2,13
"See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.",Monica Geller,3,4,2,14
"Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,2,15
"Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,2,17
That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.,Phoebe Buffay,3,4,2,18
"Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,2,19
"What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,2,20
"What, what are you doing? What are you doing?",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,2,21

"Hang up, hang up.",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,2,23
"'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,2,24
Is anybody else scared?,Chandler Bing,3,4,2,25
"'Right, well look, um, if Joey loses this audition, that is it for Estelle. I don't care! Annie you are a doll, what time can you see him?' I need a pen.",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,2,26
Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!,Chandler Bing,3,4,2,27
"Oh, now you want a pad.",Monica Geller,3,4,2,28
"There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?",Ross Geller,3,4,3,3
"Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?",Ross Geller,3,4,3,6
"You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.",Ross Geller,3,4,3,9
"Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck? No. Okay, oh, oh, how about a Dino-soilder?",Ross Geller,3,4,3,11
"Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?",Rachel Green,3,4,3,12
I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?,Monica Geller,3,4,3,13
I love that movie.,Joey Tribbiani,3,4,3,14
"There it is. Joey, what are you doing?",Monica Geller,3,4,3,15
"I'm sorry, it just felt nice.",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,3,16
Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.,Chandler Bing,3,4,3,17
"Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,3,18
"Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight. Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.",Chandler Bing,3,4,3,19
What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?,Rachel Green,3,4,3,20
"Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.",Chandler Bing,3,4,3,21
"And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?",Ross Geller,3,4,3,22
Noo.,Chandler Bing,3,4,3,23
"You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.",Ross Geller,3,4,3,24
"No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'",Chandler Bing,3,4,3,25
Men are unbelievable.,Rachel Green,3,4,3,26
"What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?",Monica Geller,3,4,3,27
"I know, that, that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.",Chandler Bing,3,4,3,28
"Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.",Monica Geller,3,4,3,29
"Hey, you know about that?!",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,3,30
"Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!",Chandler Bing,3,4,3,31
Where there is no fear of commitment.,Ross Geller,3,4,3,33
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?,Chandler Bing,3,4,3,34
"Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,3,35
"Amazingly, that makes sense.",Rachel Green,3,4,3,36
You think?,Chandler Bing,3,4,3,37
"Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,3,38
"Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.",Chandler Bing,3,4,3,39
"Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,4,2
"Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.",Rachel Green,3,4,4,3
"Come on baby, come on!",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,4,4
"'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,4,5
Very nice touch.,Rachel Green,3,4,4,6
"'Okay, go ahead.' Um, hi Annie. Fantastic! You got it. Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... Op, went through a tunnel.",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,4,7
Unbelievable.,Rachel Green,3,4,4,8
Thank you so much.,Joey Tribbiani,3,4,4,9
"It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,4,10
"You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,4,11
"Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,4,12
"Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,4,13
Two?,Phoebe Buffay,3,4,4,14
"Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,4,15
"Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,4,16
"Nooo, four.",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,4,17
"'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.",Chandler Bing,3,4,5,3
"Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.",Chandler Bing,3,4,5,5
"Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.",Chandler Bing,3,4,5,7
"Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.",Chandler Bing,3,4,5,9
"Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!",Chandler Bing,3,4,5,11
"I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.",Chandler Bing,3,4,5,13
It doesn't scare me!,Chandler Bing,3,4,5,15
"Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.",Chandler Bing,3,4,5,17
"Honey, this will help.",Rachel Green,3,4,6,2
"So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.",Chandler Bing,3,4,6,3
That is never good.,Monica Geller,3,4,6,5
Then I got all needy and clingy.,Chandler Bing,3,4,6,6
"Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?",Rachel Green,3,4,6,7
She said she'd call me.,Chandler Bing,3,4,6,8
Oh God.,Chandler Bing,3,4,6,10
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.,Monica Geller,3,4,6,11
This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.,Chandler Bing,3,4,6,12
"Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.",Rachel Green,3,4,6,13
"You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.",Monica Geller,3,4,6,14
"Yeah, you do.",Rachel Green,3,4,6,15
"So, you don't think I'm terminal?",Chandler Bing,3,4,6,16
"Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.",Monica Geller,3,4,6,17
"Okay, okay. So, should I call her?",Chandler Bing,3,4,6,18
"This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.",Rachel Green,3,4,6,20
She has to know that your not ready.,Monica Geller,3,4,6,21
"Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.",Rachel Green,3,4,6,22
"So I'm not, not gonna lose her?",Chandler Bing,3,4,6,23
"Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.",Rachel Green,3,4,6,24
"I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'",Chandler Bing,3,4,6,25
Oh.,Rachel Green,3,4,6,26
"Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.",Ross Geller,3,4,7,2
G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?,Rachel Green,3,4,7,3

"No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,7,18
"Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,7,19
They actually said that?,Joey Tribbiani,3,4,7,20
"Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,7,21
"No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent.",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,7,22
"Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,7,23
"You'll never get me, Joe!!!",Ross Geller,3,4,7,24

"Okay, shoot.",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,9,3
"Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,9,4
I didn't get it?,Joey Tribbiani,3,4,9,5
"No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,9,6
"Okay, what else?",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,9,7
"Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,9,8
Oh.,Joey Tribbiani,3,4,9,9
"Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,9,10
"Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,9,11
Oh.,Phoebe Buffay,3,4,9,12
"Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,9,13
"Yeah, no, I understand.",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,9,14
"You do, thanks.",Joey Tribbiani,3,4,9,15
Yeah. Sorry.,Phoebe Buffay,3,4,9,16

"Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.",Phoebe Buffay,3,4,9,20
That's-ah what I suspected-ah.,Joey Tribbiani,3,4,9,21
"....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.",Chandler Bing,3,4,10,2
"My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.",Monica Geller,3,4,10,3
"I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?",Chandler Bing,3,4,10,4

"Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.",Ross Geller,3,4,11,3
"Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'",Ross Geller,3,4,11,5
"What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.",Monica Geller,3,4,11,6

"Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive.

"Well um, I don't.",Rachel Green,3,7,8,18
"Thanks again, Dr. Green.",Ross Geller,3,7,8,20
"Oh, ah, you don't need that.",Ross Geller,3,7,8,24
"The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.",Ross Geller,3,7,8,26

"Nothing I do means anything, really.",Ross Geller,3,7,8,33
Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'.,Ross Geller,3,7,8,35
"Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.",Joey Tribbiani,3,7,9,2

"Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'",Ross Geller,3,7,10,14
"Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?",Rachel Green,3,7,10,15

"Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels.",Ross Geller,3,7,10,18

"Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.",Phoebe Buffay,3,11,14,7
Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?,Ross Geller,3,11,14,9
Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?,Ross Geller,3,11,14,11
"All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy?",Joey Tribbiani,3,11,14,12

"What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?",Ross Geller,3,12,1,24
Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.,Chandler Bing,3,12,1,25
"A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich. Why don't you get a magician?!",Phoebe Buffay,3,12,1,26
"Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.",Chandler Bing,3,12,1,27

Mark's a genius!,Joey Tribbiani,3,12,9,2
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?,Ross Geller,3,12,9,3

"And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'

"So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?",Monica Geller,3,12,13,2

"Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex.",Joey Tribbiani,3,13,3,38

That's a little clearer.,Ross Geller,3,14,15,14
"Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?",Rachel Green,3,14,15,15

"Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay",Phoebe Buffay,3,14,17,4
"No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it.",Phoebe Buffay,3,14,17,6
"Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?",Phoebe Buffay,3,14,17,8

I know!!,Monica Geller,3,16,7,15
God. Do think it really doesn't hurt? 'Cause how can they do that?,Phoebe Buffay,3,16,7,16

They have the best stuff in there.,Phoebe Buffay,3,16,7,18
Oh my God! Oh my God!,Chandler Bing,3,16,8,2
"Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?",Joey Tribbiani,3,16,8,3
"You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.",Ross Geller,3,16,8,4
"Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?",Chandler Bing,3,16,8,5
"What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?",Ross Geller,3,16,8,6
"Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.",Joey Tribbiani,3,16,8,7
"He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.",Chandler Bing,3,16,8,8
"Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.",Joey Tribbiani,3,16,8,9
"Yeah, but don't you think....",Ross Geller,3,16,8,10
"All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.",Chandler Bing,3,16,8,11
"Yeah, okay.",Ross Geller,3,16,8,12
"All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?",Joey Tribbiani,3,16,8,13
What trail?,Ross Geller,3,16,8,14
The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!,Joey Tribbiani,3,16,8,15
"Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.",Ross Geller,3,16,8,16
"Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!",Chandler Bing,3,16,8,17
"After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,",Phoebe Buffay,3,16,9,2
Did that!,Monica Geller,3,16,9,3
Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.,Phoebe Buffay,3,16,9,4
Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!,Monica Geller,3,16,9,5
Was it not pain-free?,Phoebe Buffay,3,16,9,6
"No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.",Monica Geller,3,16,9,7
"Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.",Phoebe Buffay,3,16,9,8
"That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.",Monica Geller,3,16,9,9
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!,Phoebe Buffay,3,16,9,10
"Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?",Monica Geller,3,16,9,11
Chloe? Hi..,Ross Geller,3,16,10,2
You took my watch?,Ross Geller,3,16,10,4
"Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?",Ross Geller,3,16,10,6
"Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?",Ross Geller,3,16,10,8
"You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven't actually met...",Ross Geller,3,16,10,10
"Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.",Ross Geller,3,16,10,12
"Yeah, that's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.",Ross Geller,3,16,10,14
"Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?",Ross Geller,3,16,10,16
"Actually, no, we're not.",Ross Geller,3,16,10,18
"No, we're not.",Ross Geller,3,16,10,20
"No, we're not!!",Ross Geller,3,16,10,22
Right.,Ross Geller,3,16,10,24
Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.,Ross Geller,3,16,10,26
Jasmine?,Ross Geller,3,16,11,2
"We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.",Ross Geller,3,16,11,4
"Yes, I did.",Ross Geller,3,16,11,6
Very bad.,Ross Geller,3,16,11,8
"I'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?",Ross Geller,3,16,11,10
"Okay, Jasmine, please, please don't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?",Ross Geller,3,16,11,12
"Thank you, thank you.",Ross Geller,3,16,11,14
Who's your roommate?,Ross Geller,3,16,11,16
"Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.",Ross Geller,3,16,12,2

We're all right.,Phoebe Buffay,3,16,13,8
"It's okay, it's okay.",Monica Geller,3,16,13,9
We're all right.,Phoebe Buffay,3,16,13,10
We were just waxing our legs.,Monica Geller,3,16,13,11
Off?!!,Chandler Bing,3,16,13,12
"For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.",Phoebe Buffay,3,16,13,13
"Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.",Chandler Bing,3,16,13,14
"Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.",Joey Tribbiani,3,16,13,15
"Oh yeah, come here.",Phoebe Buffay,3,16,13,16
"Oh, that's mature.",Chandler Bing,3,16,13,17
"Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?",Joey Tribbiani,3,16,13,18
Uh-huh.,Phoebe Buffay,3,16,13,19
That's right.,Monica Geller,3,16,13,20
"Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!",Ross Geller,3,16,13,23
I can't talk to you. I can't even look at you right now!,Rachel Green,3,16,13,25
What?,Monica Geller,3,16,13,26
"Nothing, nothing.",Chandler Bing,3,16,13,27
Rachel said everything was okay.,Monica Geller,3,16,13,28
"What, what are they talking about?",Phoebe Buffay,3,16,13,29
Rachel?,Ross Geller,3,16,13,30
Just get away from me!,Rachel Green,3,16,13,32
"No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?",Ross Geller,3,16,13,33
A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!,Rachel Green,3,16,13,34

"Ross, you had sex with another woman!",Rachel Green,3,16,13,38

Was she good?,Rachel Green,3,16,13,55
Don't answer that.,Joey Tribbiani,3,16,13,57
"Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?",Rachel Green,3,16,13,59
She was...,Ross Geller,3,16,13,60
Awful! Horrible!,Joey Tribbiani,3,16,13,62
She was not good. Not good.,Chandler Bing,3,16,13,63
She was nothing compared to you.,Joey Tribbiani,3,16,13,64
"She, she was different.",Ross Geller,3,16,13,66
Ewwwww!,Joey Tribbiani,3,16,13,68
Uh-oh.,Chandler Bing,3,16,13,69
Good different?,Rachel Green,3,16,13,71
Nobody likes change.,Ross Geller,3,16,13,72
"What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.",Ross Geller,3,16,13,74
Should we do something?,Phoebe Buffay,3,16,13,76
"Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.",Chandler Bing,3,16,13,77
"I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.",Ross Geller,3,16,13,79
"Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!",Rachel Green,3,16,13,80
"Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!",Ross Geller,3,16,13,82
And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!,Rachel Green,3,16,13,83
"Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.",Ross Geller,3,16,13,85
We were on a break!,Rachel Green,3,16,13,86
"That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.",Ross Geller,3,16,13,87
You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?,Rachel Green,3,16,13,88
"Look, I'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!",Ross Geller,3,16,13,89
"Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!",Rachel Green,3,16,13,90
"Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore.",Joey Tribbiani,3,16,13,92
"What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.",Monica Geller,3,16,13,93
Why not?! I'm hungry.,Joey Tribbiani,3,16,13,94

"Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.",Chandler Bing,3,16,13,106
"Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen someone's gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, 'cause it's like 9:15 now, and I'm not there.",Phoebe Buffay,3,16,13,108
Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?,Ross Geller,3,16,13,110
All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?,Rachel Green,3,16,13,111

"I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.",Rachel Green,3,16,13,121
"Order a pizza like, 'I forgive you?'",Ross Geller,3,16,13,122
"Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. Put olives on the pizza.",Joey Tribbiani,3,16,13,125

"Oh great, food with hair on it.",Chandler Bing,3,16,13,127
"No, not the used wax.",Phoebe Buffay,3,16,13,128

You think I need a new walk?,Joey Tribbiani,3,16,13,145
What?,Chandler Bing,3,16,13,146

Are you actually saying these words?,Chandler Bing,3,16,13,148
"What, now you're not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on!

"Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay.",Joey Tribbiani,3,16,13,152

"Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.",Phoebe Buffay,3,16,13,154
"Y'know what, y'know what, I'm-I'm not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You're the one that bailed on us. You're the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!",Ross Geller,3,16,13,156
That's....,Rachel Green,3,16,13,157
That's what?!,Ross Geller,3,16,13,158
That is neither here nor there.,Rachel Green,3,16,13,159
"Okay, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.",Ross Geller,3,16,13,160
"No Ross!! Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?",Rachel Green,3,16,13,162
"Okay, okay, okay.",Ross Geller,3,16,13,163
I think you should go.,Rachel Green,3,16,13,164

"Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together...",Ross Geller,3,16,13,167
"Yeah, what the hell did I know!",Rachel Green,3,16,13,168
"Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and....",Ross Geller,3,16,13,169
"No. I can't, you're a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't, it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It's just changed, everything. Forever.",Rachel Green,3,16,13,170
"Yeah, but this can't be it, I mean.",Ross Geller,3,16,13,172
Then how come it is?,Rachel Green,3,16,13,174
They've been quiet for a long time.,Phoebe Buffay,3,16,14,2
Maybe she killed him?,Joey Tribbiani,3,16,14,3

"Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....",Joey Tribbiani,3,17,1,12
"Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.",Chandler Bing,3,17,1,13
Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.,Joey Tribbiani,3,17,1,14
Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.,Phoebe Buffay,3,17,1,15
"Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.",Joey Tribbiani,3,17,1,16
"Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.",Phoebe Buffay,3,17,1,17
"Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.",Chandler Bing,3,17,1,18
"Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....",Phoebe Buffay,3,17,1,19
I had the same dream!,Joey Tribbiani,3,17,1,20
"Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.",Phoebe Buffay,3,17,1,21
"Oh, I had the opposite dream.",Joey Tribbiani,3,17,1,22
"Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.",Chandler Bing,3,17,1,23
"Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship.",Joey Tribbiani,3,17,1,24

"Okay, let's go!! Let's hit the road!!",Monica Geller,3,17,1,27
Hey!,Rachel Green,3,17,1,28

That is so cool.,Rachel Green,3,25,1,16
"I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?",Phoebe Buffay,3,25,1,17

Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.,Monica Geller,3,25,2,13
Hey!,Joey Tribbiani,3,25,2,14
"Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!",Monica Geller,3,25,2,15

I think she would like that.,Phoebe Buffay,4,2,14,32
"Come here, here, come here, come here, Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend's mother.",Ross Geller,4,2,14,33
Thank you. We both forgive you.,Phoebe Buffay,4,2,14,34

I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.,Monica Geller,4,3,2,4
How come?,Phoebe Buffay,4,3,2,5
"Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.",Monica Geller,4,3,2,6
"Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.",Ross Geller,4,3,2,7
You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.,Monica Geller,4,3,2,8

"Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.",Chandler Bing,4,3,3,14
"Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!",Rachel Green,4,3,3,16

You promised you would break up with her!,Rachel Green,4,3,8,18
"I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!",Chandler Bing,4,3,8,19
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!,Rachel Green,4,3,8,20
"It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.",Chandler Bing,4,3,8,21
"Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.",Rachel Green,4,3,8,22

Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?,Rachel Green,4,3,8,34

What?,Monica Geller,4,3,10,9
"Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, ""Yeah, he pulled a Monica."" Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, ""Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica."" Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, ""Yeah, that one's outta here."" Though some things don't change.",Phoebe Buffay,4,3,10,10
"All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make.",Monica Geller,4,3,10,11
Wow! My breasts are really strong.,Phoebe Buffay,4,3,10,13

D'oh!! I've got it!,Rachel Green,4,3,13,8
You don't have it.,Chandler Bing,4,3,13,9
"I have so got it. There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.",Rachel Green,4,3,13,10
How do Monica and Phoebe know?,Chandler Bing,4,3,13,11
"Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy.",Rachel Green,4,3,13,12
Go on.,Chandler Bing,4,3,13,13

It's hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.,Phoebe Buffay,4,3,14,7
And you?,Monica Geller,4,3,14,9
"So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you...",Monica Geller,4,3,14,11
"Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.",Monica Geller,4,3,14,13
Wow!,Monica Geller,4,3,14,15
"Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn't know we switched it.",Phoebe Buffay,4,3,14,16
"That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don't bite your nails.",Monica Geller,4,3,14,18

Is she great or what?,Joey Tribbiani,4,5,11,3
"Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.",Chandler Bing,4,5,11,5
Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.,Chandler Bing,4,5,11,7
"Uhh, no-no thanks.",Chandler Bing,4,5,11,9
"Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.",Chandler Bing,4,5,11,11
I'll be right back. What was that?,Joey Tribbiani,4,5,11,12

Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.,Joey Tribbiani,4,5,11,14
"Hey, look, what do you want from me?",Chandler Bing,4,5,11,15
"I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.",Joey Tribbiani,4,5,11,16
I am pretending.,Chandler Bing,4,5,11,17
"Well then, do it better!",Joey Tribbiani,4,5,11,18
"Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!",Chandler Bing,4,5,11,19
"Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.",Joey Tribbiani,4,5,11,20
"Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?",Ross Geller,4,5,12,2

"Ross, cough drops, please?",Monica Geller,4,5,12,7
At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.,Ross Geller,4,5,12,8
"Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.",Rachel Green,4,5,12,9

"And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'",Monica Geller,4,5,12,13
"Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!",Rachel Green,4,5,12,15
"That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!",Monica Geller,4,5,12,16
Fine.,Ross Geller,4,5,12,17
Sorry.,Rachel Green,4,5,12,18

"Yeah, come to papa.",Phoebe Buffay,4,6,1,7
I know!,Ross Geller,4,6,1,9
"Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?",Monica Geller,4,6,1,10
"Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?",Chandler Bing,4,6,1,11
"Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?",Rachel Green,4,6,1,12
"Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.",Ross Geller,4,6,1,13
"Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.",Chandler Bing,4,6,1,14
"I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.",Ross Geller,4,6,1,15
Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.,Rachel Green,4,6,1,16
Fine by me; hope she wins.,Ross Geller,4,6,1,17
Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?,Chandler Bing,4,6,2,2

"Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!",Rachel Green,4,6,2,9
"Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.",Chandler Bing,4,6,2,10
"Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?",Rachel Green,4,6,2,11
"Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.",Chandler Bing,4,6,2,12
"Oh, honey, that's so sweet.",Rachel Green,4,6,2,13
"Yeah, and what a great way to say, ""I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!""",Phoebe Buffay,4,6,2,14
It doesn't say that. Does it?,Chandler Bing,4,6,2,15
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?,Ross Geller,4,6,2,16
"Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.",Chandler Bing,4,6,2,17

"Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.",Monica Geller,4,6,2,19
Oh my God! What happened?,Rachel Green,4,6,2,20
Sixty guests.,Monica Geller,4,6,2,21
"So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?",Ross Geller,4,6,2,22
Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.,Monica Geller,4,6,2,23
"Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?",Phoebe Buffay,4,6,2,24
I don't know.,Monica Geller,4,6,2,25
"There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!",Phoebe Buffay,4,6,2,26
Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.,Monica Geller,4,6,2,27
"Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.",Phoebe Buffay,4,6,2,28
"Well, you're not working either.",Monica Geller,4,6,2,29
"Yes, but I'm doing this.",Phoebe Buffay,4,6,2,30

"And not one of your coupons for an hour of ""Joey Love.""",Rachel Green,4,6,2,45
"Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?",Phoebe Buffay,4,6,2,47
"No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.",Rachel Green,4,6,2,48
Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.,Phoebe Buffay,4,6,2,49
Hey!,Monica Geller,4,6,2,51
"Hey, how'd it go?",Rachel Green,4,6,2,52
"Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow-the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!",Monica Geller,4,6,2,53

"I'll have one, please. Plus my money.",Phoebe Buffay,4,6,2,56
"Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look-I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.",Monica Geller,4,6,2,57
"Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.",Phoebe Buffay,4,6,2,58

"Oh, yeah, why not?",Ross Geller,4,6,3,14
"Oh, is everything in the car?",Monica Geller,4,6,4,2

"Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.",Joey Tribbiani,4,6,5,11
"Yes, it is, at Office Max.",Chandler Bing,4,6,5,12
What did you get her?,Rachel Green,4,6,5,13
A pen.,Chandler Bing,4,6,5,14
It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?,Joey Tribbiani,4,6,5,15
Huh-huh! You can't give her that.,Chandler Bing,4,6,5,16
Why not?,Joey Tribbiani,4,6,5,17
Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!,Chandler Bing,4,6,5,18
"Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?",Rachel Green,4,6,5,19
"Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... ""Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!""",Joey Tribbiani,4,6,5,20

"But Mon, you have to get our money!",Phoebe Buffay,4,6,6,2
"Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.",Monica Geller,4,6,6,3
"I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?",Phoebe Buffay,4,6,6,4
What?,Monica Geller,4,6,6,5
"Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, ""that massage wasn't long enough, or, ""I don't recognize any of those songs,"" or, you know, ""these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!""",Phoebe Buffay,4,6,6,6
Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?,Monica Geller,4,6,6,7

You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?,Ross Geller,4,6,7,3
Yeah.,Joey Tribbiani,4,6,7,4
"Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here.",Ross Geller,4,6,7,5
"Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?",Joey Tribbiani,4,6,7,6
What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.,Ross Geller,4,6,7,7
"All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.",Joey Tribbiani,4,6,7,8
"No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.",Ross Geller,4,6,7,9
What kind of smell?,Joey Tribbiani,4,6,7,10
I don't know. Soap?,Ross Geller,4,6,7,11
"All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?",Joey Tribbiani,4,6,7,12
Yeah.,Ross Geller,4,6,7,13
"You wanna see her again, right?",Joey Tribbiani,4,6,7,14

"It's, uh... it's endearing, really.",Ross Geller,4,6,7,21
All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!,Joey Tribbiani,4,6,7,22
"Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.",Chandler Bing,4,6,8,2
Any luck?,Rachel Green,4,6,8,3
"Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called ""Invisible things for Kathy."" Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?",Chandler Bing,4,6,8,4
"All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.",Rachel Green,4,6,8,5
"She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.",Chandler Bing,4,6,8,6
"Aw, honey, that's so sweet.",Rachel Green,4,6,8,7
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?,Chandler Bing,4,6,8,8
Oh! Pathetic!,Rachel Green,4,6,8,9
Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!,Joey Tribbiani,4,6,8,10

A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?,Joey Tribbiani,4,6,8,14
"No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?",Chandler Bing,4,6,8,15
"You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?",Joey Tribbiani,4,6,8,16
"No, it came out to an even twenty.",Chandler Bing,4,6,8,17
Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.,Joey Tribbiani,4,6,8,18
"You didn't get the money, did you?",Phoebe Buffay,4,6,9,4
"Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!",Monica Geller,4,6,9,5
"No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! Hey, widow?",Phoebe Buffay,4,6,9,6
"Okay, Widow!",Phoebe Buffay,4,6,9,8
"Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.",Phoebe Buffay,4,6,9,10

"Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.",Ross Geller,4,7,1,3
"It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!",Chandler Bing,4,7,1,4
Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?,Phoebe Buffay,4,7,1,6

Wait! You're going out with Kathy!,Chandler Bing,4,7,2,11
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?,Joey Tribbiani,4,7,2,12
"Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.",Chandler Bing,4,7,2,13
What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.,Joey Tribbiani,4,7,2,14
"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.",Chandler Bing,4,7,2,15
You got all that from the back of her head?,Joey Tribbiani,4,7,2,16

"Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.",Monica Geller,4,7,3,9

"He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, ""The Sound.""",Monica Geller,4,7,3,11

"All right! Bring it on, you...",Chandler Bing,4,7,3,19

Oh my God! Play!,Chandler Bing,4,7,3,21
"Boy, that was-that was, umm... terrific.",Monica Geller,4,7,3,23
"Really, bitchin'!",Chandler Bing,4,7,3,24

"Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!",Rachel Green,4,7,3,27
"Wow! Thanks, you guys. That's uh-ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay? This is so nice, I'm-I am so...",Ross Geller,4,7,3,28
Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!,Monica Geller,4,7,3,29
"Oh, I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.",Rachel Green,4,7,3,30

"Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.",Chandler Bing,4,7,4,20
"So I guess it's just uh, you and me then.",Chandler Bing,4,7,4,22
"Yeah, I think it is!",Chandler Bing,4,7,4,24
"Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut...",Chandler Bing,4,7,4,26

"No-no, Kathy.",Joey Tribbiani,4,7,7,18
Could be Casey.,Chandler Bing,4,7,7,19
"No. No, Kathy.",Joey Tribbiani,4,7,7,20
Consider Casey.,Chandler Bing,4,7,7,21

You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.,Monica Geller,4,7,9,9
"No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.",Ross Geller,4,7,9,10
"Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?",Chandler Bing,4,7,9,11
"I think maybe, yeah.",Phoebe Buffay,4,7,9,12

"Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.",Chandler Bing,4,7,10,22

Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!,Joey Tribbiani,4,7,10,35
"You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.",Chandler Bing,4,7,10,36
"Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!",Joey Tribbiani,4,7,10,37
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!,Chandler Bing,4,7,10,38

Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?,Chandler Bing,4,8,2,17
"Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!",Phoebe Buffay,4,8,2,18
"Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it... Oh, there was no big dog.

Like I remember his office number! Speed dial 7.,Monica Geller,4,8,2,40

"Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?",Chandler Bing,4,8,6,8
"Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.",Joey Tribbiani,4,8,6,9
"Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!",Chandler Bing,4,8,6,10
Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.,Joey Tribbiani,4,8,6,11
"All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!",Chandler Bing,4,8,6,13
"When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!",Joey Tribbiani,4,8,6,14

"All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?",Chandler Bing,4,8,6,17
We've got a box.,Joey Tribbiani,4,8,6,18
I was probably waiting for it to open.,Monica Geller,4,8,7,3
You look great too.,Monica Geller,4,8,7,5
So how does it look?,Monica Geller,4,8,7,7

He's coming here for Thanksgiving!,Ross Geller,4,8,8,2
"I know, it's sick.",Rachel Green,4,8,8,3

"Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?",Monica Geller,4,8,8,6
"Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.",Phoebe Buffay,4,8,8,7

Is he okay in there?,Rachel Green,4,8,8,13

"Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.",Ross Geller,4,8,8,15
"Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!",Monica Geller,4,8,8,16
"So now, what exactly is the point of the box?",Rachel Green,4,8,8,17
Chandler?,Joey Tribbiani,4,8,8,18
"The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!",Chandler Bing,4,8,8,19
"Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?",Ross Geller,4,8,8,20

See he's nice. Right?,Monica Geller,4,8,8,60
"Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, ""That's not how your dad used to do it.""",Phoebe Buffay,4,8,8,61
I saved you a seat.,Monica Geller,4,8,8,63
Sick-sick-sick-sick.,Rachel Green,4,8,8,64
"Oh, I'll get it.",Phoebe Buffay,4,8,8,66
Gotcha!,Chandler Bing,4,8,8,67
That doesn't sound like thinking to me!,Joey Tribbiani,4,8,8,68

"Okay, fine.",Rachel Green,4,8,8,77
"You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!",Chandler Bing,4,8,8,79
"All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!",Joey Tribbiani,4,8,8,80
"You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.",Chandler Bing,4,8,8,81
So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?,Joey Tribbiani,4,8,8,82
Absolutely!,Chandler Bing,4,8,8,83
That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.,Joey Tribbiani,4,8,8,84
"Don't say that I have no sentiment! This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! This is from the museum from the first time we... were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!",Rachel Green,4,8,8,86
"I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.",Ross Geller,4,8,8,87

"I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.",Monica Geller,4,8,8,96
We're just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?,Monica Geller,4,8,8,98
Nothing. Nothing.,Monica Geller,4,8,8,101
"No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss...",Monica Geller,4,8,8,103

In the box.,Joey Tribbiani,4,8,8,118

"It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.",Monica Geller,4,9,10,22
You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!,Phoebe Buffay,4,9,10,23
"All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.",Monica Geller,4,9,10,24

Okay.,Ross Geller,4,9,11,4
"So, we're having fun, right?",Joey Tribbiani,4,9,11,5

"Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?",Chandler Bing,4,9,11,16
"I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.",Joey Tribbiani,4,9,11,17
"I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.",Ross Geller,4,9,11,18
How sad are we?,Ross Geller,4,9,11,20
"Yeah, I know.",Joey Tribbiani,4,9,11,21
"Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!",Chandler Bing,4,9,11,22

"All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.",Monica Geller,4,9,12,10
No.,Phoebe Buffay,4,9,12,11
"Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.",Monica Geller,4,9,12,12
No.,Phoebe Buffay,4,9,12,13
"Y'know what, let's do the catering business.",Monica Geller,4,9,12,14

Really?!,Monica Geller,4,9,12,18

Heard what?,Rachel Green,4,9,13,4

"Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!",Rachel Green,4,9,13,8
"Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God.",Rachel Green,4,9,13,10
"Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened.",Rachel Green,4,9,13,12
"Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?",Rachel Green,4,9,13,14
"Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna...",Rachel Green,4,9,13,17
"Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... Are you gonna kill me?",Monica Geller,4,9,14,3
Hey!,Ross Geller,4,10,1,2

"Oh, which museum?",Phoebe Buffay,4,10,1,11
"No, answer his.",Phoebe Buffay,4,10,1,12
"Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.",Ross Geller,4,10,1,13
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?,Chandler Bing,4,10,1,14
"No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.",Ross Geller,4,10,1,15
How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.,Chandler Bing,4,10,1,16
"Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?",Joey Tribbiani,4,10,1,17
"Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.",Chandler Bing,4,10,2,2
"Umm, that paper's two weeks old.",Phoebe Buffay,4,10,2,3
"All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can't believe I missed it.",Chandler Bing,4,10,2,4
"Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then bang!-before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! Y'know, I want a man!! I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship, y'know, just like a fling would be great.",Rachel Green,4,10,2,5
Really?! I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.,Chandler Bing,4,10,2,6
"Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.",Rachel Green,4,10,2,7
"Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.",Joey Tribbiani,4,10,2,8
"Y'know what? There's some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?",Chandler Bing,4,10,2,9
"Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?",Rachel Green,4,10,2,10
"Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.",Chandler Bing,4,10,2,11
"Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don't like guys with boring jobs.",Rachel Green,4,10,2,12
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?,Chandler Bing,4,10,2,13
What's wrong Mon?,Phoebe Buffay,4,10,2,16
"Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.",Monica Geller,4,10,2,17
Oh.,Phoebe Buffay,4,10,2,18
"I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.",Monica Geller,4,10,2,19
"Hey, maybe they meant to write, 'Quiet, bitch.'",Phoebe Buffay,4,10,2,20
"Hey, honey! What's the matter? Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!",Rachel Green,4,10,2,21
I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.,Monica Geller,4,10,2,22
Ohhh!,Joey Tribbiani,4,10,2,23
"I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I've been waiting for my whole life.",Monica Geller,4,10,2,24
"Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?",Rachel Green,4,10,2,25
"I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.",Monica Geller,4,10,2,26
"Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.",Chandler Bing,4,10,2,27
"Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?",Joey Tribbiani,4,10,2,28
"That's a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?",Monica Geller,4,10,2,29
Good enough to get fired.,Joey Tribbiani,4,10,2,30

"I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!",Chandler Bing,4,10,3,2
"See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.",Chandler Bing,4,10,3,4
"Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.",Chandler Bing,4,10,3,6
"Oh, by the way, that is her full name.",Chandler Bing,4,10,3,8
"Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!",Chandler Bing,4,10,3,13
"Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!",Chandler Bing,4,10,3,15
"Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?",Phoebe Buffay,4,10,4,2

"But y'know umm, Rachel doesn't rhyme with draddle.",Rachel Green,4,10,4,7
I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!,Phoebe Buffay,4,10,4,8
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.,Joey Tribbiani,4,10,4,9
"All good, thanks. Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that's easier to rhyme?",Phoebe Buffay,4,10,4,10

"Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?",Joey Tribbiani,4,10,4,35
"No! No, the robots just work for them.",Phoebe Buffay,4,10,4,36
"All right, I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?",Monica Geller,4,10,4,37
"Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!",Joey Tribbiani,4,10,4,38
You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!,Monica Geller,4,10,4,39

You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?,Ross Geller,4,10,5,4
Yeah.,Chandler Bing,4,10,5,5
"Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun.",Ross Geller,4,10,5,6
"If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?",Phoebe Buffay,4,10,5,7
"Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.",Ross Geller,4,10,5,8
Hey!,Joey Tribbiani,4,10,5,9
Hey!,Ross Geller,4,10,5,10

"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?",Monica Geller,4,10,8,2
"Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.",Joey Tribbiani,4,10,8,3
There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!,Joey Tribbiani,4,10,8,5
"Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?",Monica Geller,4,10,8,7
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?,Monica Geller,4,10,8,9
"Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere...",Monica Geller,4,10,8,11
"A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!",Monica Geller,4,10,8,13

"I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, ""Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!""",Joey Tribbiani,4,10,9,3
"Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!",Monica Geller,4,10,9,4

What kinda things have you been saying?,Monica Geller,4,10,9,6
"Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.",Joey Tribbiani,4,10,9,7

"The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date.",Ross Geller,4,10,10,10
"So, did you pick one yet?",Phoebe Buffay,4,10,10,11
"No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought-it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn.",Ross Geller,4,10,10,12
"Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!",Phoebe Buffay,4,10,10,13
"Y'know, you're right. Thank you.",Ross Geller,4,10,10,14
"Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.",Phoebe Buffay,4,10,10,15

"Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?",Rachel Green,4,10,11,2
I did! I absolutely did!,Chandler Bing,4,10,11,3
You idiot!!,Rachel Green,4,10,11,4
"I'm sure you're right, but why?",Chandler Bing,4,10,11,5
You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!,Rachel Green,4,10,11,6
"Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.",Chandler Bing,4,10,11,7
"Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!",Rachel Green,4,10,11,8

Have you ever been with a woman?,Chandler Bing,4,10,11,20
"What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!",Rachel Green,4,10,11,21
So there is no good time to ask that question.,Chandler Bing,4,10,11,22
I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish?,Monica Geller,4,10,13,2

How? How is your fault?,Phoebe Buffay,4,13,12,31
"Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!",Chandler Bing,4,13,12,32
"Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.",Rachel Green,4,13,12,33

"Well, h-how is this like that?",Rachel Green,4,22,10,16

"Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!",Rachel Green,4,23,8,23
"Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, ""Hey, you like things clean."" Or, y'know, ""Hey, Joey, you're gay.""",Phoebe Buffay,4,23,8,24
What?!,Rachel Green,4,23,8,26
"Oh, please! She's always got a broom in her hand!",Phoebe Buffay,4,23,8,27

Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?,Ross Geller,4,23,10,5
She said what?,Ross Geller,4,23,10,7
"Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? This isn't right.",Ross Geller,4,23,10,9
I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?,Ross Geller,4,23,10,11
The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.,Ross Geller,4,23,10,13
No. I'm saying it's now.,Ross Geller,4,23,10,15
There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!,Ross Geller,4,23,10,17

"Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?",Rachel Green,4,23,11,13
"Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.",Phoebe Buffay,4,23,11,14
I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.,Rachel Green,4,23,11,15
"Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! Hah?",Phoebe Buffay,4,23,11,16
"I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.",Rachel Green,4,23,11,17
"Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy.",Phoebe Buffay,4,23,11,18
Okay.,Rachel Green,4,23,11,19
Okay?,Phoebe Buffay,4,23,11,20

Ow!,Rachel Green,4,23,11,25
"Okay, how do you feel now?",Phoebe Buffay,4,23,11,26
"Well, I like you less!",Rachel Green,4,23,11,27

Hey.,Chandler Bing,4,23,12,5
Oh. Sorry!,Joey Tribbiani,4,23,12,6

"So, I hear you're single now...",Joey Tribbiani,4,23,12,22
How did you? How? How?,Chandler Bing,4,23,12,24
"Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I'm in my map and-and... Hey!",Joey Tribbiani,4,23,12,25
Hey!,Monica Geller,4,23,12,26

I'm gonna go to the bathroom.,Chandler Bing,4,23,12,31
Wait up!,Joey Tribbiani,4,23,12,32
"Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?",Ross Geller,4,23,12,33
She said that?!,Monica Geller,4,23,12,34
Yeah.,Ross Geller,4,23,12,35
Why?!,Monica Geller,4,23,12,36

Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!,Monica Geller,4,23,12,38
Excuse me?,Ross Geller,4,23,12,39
"Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?",Monica Geller,4,23,12,40
I don't know. A month?,Ross Geller,4,23,12,41
"Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.",Monica Geller,4,23,12,42
"I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.",Ross Geller,4,23,12,43
Sometimes we were.,Monica Geller,4,23,12,44
Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?,Ross Geller,4,23,12,45
Okay.,Monica Geller,4,23,12,46

"That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?",Joey Tribbiani,4,23,13,11
"Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?",Phoebe Buffay,4,23,13,12
"Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.",Joey Tribbiani,4,23,13,13
So you're not homesick yet?,Phoebe Buffay,4,23,13,14

"But what about all the ""finding-his-flaws"" stuff we've been doing?",Phoebe Buffay,4,23,15,9
"Yeah, that didn't work.",Rachel Green,4,23,15,10
"I-Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!",Phoebe Buffay,4,23,15,11
"Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.",Rachel Green,4,23,15,12
"That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy.""",Phoebe Buffay,4,23,15,13
Ohh-Do you think he will?!,Rachel Green,4,23,15,14

"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.",Monica Geller,5,3,15,6
"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.",Chandler Bing,5,3,15,7

Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me.

"Uh-huh, that one!",Monica Geller,5,4,1,9
"Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him.",Rachel Green,5,4,1,10
"Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.",Monica Geller,5,4,1,11
Why aren't you guys at the movie?,Rachel Green,5,4,1,12
"Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!",Joey Tribbiani,5,4,1,13

He's talking to London!,Joey Tribbiani,5,4,1,15
But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?,Monica Geller,5,4,1,16
"Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.",Joey Tribbiani,5,4,1,17
"I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!",Ross Geller,5,4,1,18

"Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.",Joey Tribbiani,5,4,2,4
"Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?",Monica Geller,5,4,2,5
"Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!",Joey Tribbiani,5,4,2,6
Oh that's great!,Monica Geller,5,4,2,7
"A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!",Joey Tribbiani,5,4,2,8
"Ugh, PBS!",Phoebe Buffay,5,4,2,9

"Ugh, what's right with them?",Phoebe Buffay,5,4,2,11
"Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?",Joey Tribbiani,5,4,2,12
"Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.",Phoebe Buffay,5,4,2,13
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.,Chandler Bing,5,4,2,14
All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!,Phoebe Buffay,5,4,2,15
"I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.",Joey Tribbiani,5,4,2,16
"This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.",Phoebe Buffay,5,4,2,17
"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!",Joey Tribbiani,5,4,2,18
What-what are you talking about?!,Phoebe Buffay,5,4,2,19
"Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?",Joey Tribbiani,5,4,2,20
Yeah. So?,Phoebe Buffay,5,4,2,21
"It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.",Joey Tribbiani,5,4,2,22
Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.,Phoebe Buffay,5,4,2,23
"Well, may I ask for one example?",Joey Tribbiani,5,4,2,24
"Yeah, it's... Y'know there's-no you may not!",Phoebe Buffay,5,4,2,25
That's because all people are selfish.,Joey Tribbiani,5,4,2,27
Are you calling me selfish?!,Phoebe Buffay,5,4,2,28
"Are you calling you people? Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?",Joey Tribbiani,5,4,2,29
"I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.",Phoebe Buffay,5,4,2,30

"Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?",Phoebe Buffay,5,4,2,42
That he doesn't exist.,Joey Tribbiani,5,4,2,43

"So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?",Rachel Green,5,4,3,2
"Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.",Chandler Bing,5,4,3,3
"So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?",Rachel Green,5,4,3,4
"Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",Monica Geller,5,4,3,5
"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.",Chandler Bing,5,4,3,6
I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!,Rachel Green,5,4,3,7
Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?,Chandler Bing,5,4,3,9
I might've said that. Why is that funny?,Monica Geller,5,4,3,10
"Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog!",Chandler Bing,5,4,3,11

But you live here! You know that.,Monica Geller,5,4,3,20
What-what-what are you gonna do?,Rachel Green,5,4,3,21
I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.,Ross Geller,5,4,3,22
"Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.",Monica Geller,5,4,3,23
It could happen.,Ross Geller,5,4,3,24
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!,Joey Tribbiani,5,4,4,2
"That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.",Joey Tribbiani,5,4,4,4
But I'm the host!,Joey Tribbiani,5,4,4,6
"You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.",Joey Tribbiani,5,4,4,8
"I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!",Phoebe Buffay,5,4,5,2
Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.,Rachel Green,5,4,5,3
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!,Phoebe Buffay,5,4,5,4
"Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?",Chandler Bing,5,4,5,5
Sure!,Monica Geller,5,4,5,6
"If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?",Chandler Bing,5,4,5,7
Chandler! Is he?,Rachel Green,5,4,5,8
"Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.",Monica Geller,5,4,5,9
"Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.",Chandler Bing,5,4,5,10
"All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.",Ross Geller,5,4,6,2
"Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?",Ross Geller,5,4,6,4
"Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.",Ross Geller,5,4,6,6
"All right, did you just say all right?",Ross Geller,5,4,6,8
"Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!",Ross Geller,5,4,6,10

"I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you!",Ross Geller,5,4,7,9
"Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.",Chandler Bing,5,4,7,10
"Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.",Monica Geller,5,4,7,11
Yeah.,Phoebe Buffay,5,4,7,12
That's true!,Chandler Bing,5,4,7,13
"Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.",Phoebe Buffay,5,4,7,14
That's true!,Chandler Bing,5,4,7,15
"No, you cannot.",Monica Geller,5,4,7,16
"Thanks for the help, problem solved.",Ross Geller,5,4,7,17

"Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.",Chandler Bing,5,4,8,8
"William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.",Monica Geller,5,4,8,9
"Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.",Chandler Bing,5,4,8,10
"Yeah, so?",Monica Geller,5,4,8,11
"Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.",Chandler Bing,5,4,8,12
"Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.",Monica Geller,5,4,8,13
Why?,Chandler Bing,5,4,8,14
Why?,Monica Geller,5,4,8,15
What's your point?,Chandler Bing,5,4,8,16
PBS telethon.,Joey Tribbiani,5,4,9,2
"Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.",Phoebe Buffay,5,4,9,3
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?,Joey Tribbiani,5,4,9,4
"Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.",Phoebe Buffay,5,4,9,5
"Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.",Joey Tribbiani,5,4,9,6
"Aw, dammit!",Phoebe Buffay,5,4,9,7
"Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?",Joey Tribbiani,5,4,9,10
Come on man! You've been here all day!,Joey Tribbiani,5,4,9,12
"Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate.",Ross Geller,5,4,10,2
"A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!",Monica Geller,5,4,10,3
"Ooh, it's not a toy.",Phoebe Buffay,5,4,10,4
"Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!",Ross Geller,5,4,10,5

"$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?",Joey Tribbiani,5,4,11,6
"Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.",Phoebe Buffay,5,4,11,7
And you don't a little good about donating the money?,Joey Tribbiani,5,4,11,8

Keep talking.,Monica Geller,5,4,12,3
"I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.",Chandler Bing,5,4,12,4
Really?,Monica Geller,5,4,12,5
"Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!",Chandler Bing,5,4,12,6
"Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?",Monica Geller,5,4,12,7

For what?,Ross Geller,5,4,13,3
For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.,Rachel Green,5,4,13,4

"Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!",Rachel Green,5,4,13,6

"Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.",Rachel Green,5,4,13,10

"Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!",Rachel Green,5,4,13,12
Thanks.,Ross Geller,5,4,13,13
"Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!",Rachel Green,5,4,13,14

"Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?",Monica Geller,5,5,2,37

"Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!",Chandler Bing,5,5,3,10
"No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?",Monica Geller,5,5,3,11
"Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!",Chandler Bing,5,5,3,12

"Okay, great.",Chandler Bing,5,5,5,3
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!,Chandler Bing,5,5,5,5
We're switching rooms again.,Monica Geller,5,5,5,6

"Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!",Monica Geller,5,5,5,21
"Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?",Chandler Bing,5,5,5,22
"I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!",Monica Geller,5,5,5,23

"Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!",Rachel Green,5,5,6,12

"I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.",Joey Tribbiani,5,5,8,20
That's not Ross!,Rachel Green,5,5,8,21
Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.,Phoebe Buffay,5,5,8,22

"Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.",Rachel Green,5,5,8,24
"Hey, you're not Kip!",Joey Tribbiani,5,5,8,25

"Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.",Chandler Bing,5,5,8,28
"Oh, that poor bastard.",Joey Tribbiani,5,5,8,29
"See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!",Rachel Green,5,5,8,30
You're not gonna be phased out!,Monica Geller,5,5,8,31
"Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.",Rachel Green,5,5,8,32
Ehh!!,Phoebe Buffay,5,5,8,33
"Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.",Rachel Green,5,5,8,34

Yes that would have made more sense.,Chandler Bing,5,5,9,6
"Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!",Joey Tribbiani,5,5,9,7
Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me!,Rachel Green,5,5,10,2

"Oh, Ross...",Rachel Green,5,5,10,11
"No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?",Ross Geller,5,5,10,12
"No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.",Rachel Green,5,5,10,13
"Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?",Ross Geller,5,5,10,14
"Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!",Rachel Green,5,5,10,15
I can't believe this is happening.,Ross Geller,5,5,10,16
I know.,Rachel Green,5,5,10,17
I am so sorry.,Ross Geller,5,5,10,18
I know that too.,Rachel Green,5,5,10,19
"Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.",Joey Tribbiani,5,5,10,20

"So, I guess this is over.",Chandler Bing,5,5,11,6
What?,Monica Geller,5,5,11,7
"Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.",Chandler Bing,5,5,11,8
"Why, exactly?",Monica Geller,5,5,11,9
"Because of the weekend, we had a fight.",Chandler Bing,5,5,11,10
Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!,Monica Geller,5,5,11,11

"Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!",Monica Geller,5,5,12,18
How?! When?!,Joey Tribbiani,5,5,12,19
It happened in London.,Chandler Bing,5,5,12,20
IN LONDON!!!,Joey Tribbiani,5,5,12,21
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.,Chandler Bing,5,5,12,22
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!,Joey Tribbiani,5,5,12,23
No-no-no-no-no! You can't!,Chandler Bing,5,5,12,25
"Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.",Monica Geller,5,5,12,26
"All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but...",Joey Tribbiani,5,5,12,28
"I know, it's great!",Monica Geller,5,5,12,29
"Aww, I don't want to see that!",Joey Tribbiani,5,5,12,31
We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!,Phoebe Buffay,5,5,12,33
"The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, ""Hi, Phoebe!""",Phoebe Buffay,5,5,13,2
"Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.",Monica Geller,5,5,13,3
Count for what?,Phoebe Buffay,5,5,13,4
Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.,Monica Geller,5,5,13,5
I guess I'm done.,Joey Tribbiani,5,5,13,7
Fun's over!,Chandler Bing,5,5,13,8
"Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!",Monica Geller,5,5,13,9
Uh-huh!,Rachel Green,5,5,13,10

"Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!",Monica Geller,5,5,13,12
"Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!",Joey Tribbiani,5,6,1,2
What?!,Monica Geller,5,6,1,3
"Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.",Joey Tribbiani,5,6,1,4
Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?,Chandler Bing,5,6,1,5
"Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.",Joey Tribbiani,5,6,1,6
Sorry.,Monica Geller,5,6,1,8
Sorry.,Chandler Bing,5,6,1,9
I can hear that!,Joey Tribbiani,5,6,1,11
Rachel's at work.,Monica Geller,5,6,1,12
I can still hear you!,Joey Tribbiani,5,6,1,15
Hey!,Phoebe Buffay,5,6,2,2
Hey!,Joey Tribbiani,5,6,2,3
Hello!,Chandler Bing,5,6,2,4
"Hey, what's that?",Monica Geller,5,6,2,5
"Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.",Phoebe Buffay,5,6,2,6
Eeeee--ohh!! God!,Phoebe Buffay,5,6,2,8
"Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?",Joey Tribbiani,5,6,2,9
"Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!",Phoebe Buffay,5,6,2,10
"Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. That didn't happen, I made that up!",Chandler Bing,5,6,2,11
Hey!,Ross Geller,5,6,2,12
How come? Everybody else does.,Ross Geller,5,6,2,14
What is that?,Monica Geller,5,6,2,16
"Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.",Ross Geller,5,6,2,17
This is all of your things.,Monica Geller,5,6,2,18
"Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's-Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.",Ross Geller,5,6,2,19
"So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.",Monica Geller,5,6,2,20
Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.,Ross Geller,5,6,2,21
"Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?",Joey Tribbiani,5,6,2,23
"Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.",Ross Geller,5,6,2,24
"Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?",Chandler Bing,5,6,2,25
After what I did? Can you blame her?,Ross Geller,5,6,2,26
"Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.",Phoebe Buffay,5,6,2,27
"What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?",Joey Tribbiani,5,6,2,29
Now calm down Joey.,Monica Geller,5,6,2,30
"No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!",Joey Tribbiani,5,6,2,31
"Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.",Phoebe Buffay,5,6,2,32
"Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...",Chandler Bing,5,6,2,33
"Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?",Monica Geller,5,6,2,34
"No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.",Joey Tribbiani,5,6,2,35
"Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?",Rachel Green,5,6,3,2
"Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.",Monica Geller,5,6,3,3
I want the little round waffles.,Rachel Green,5,6,3,4
"All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?",Monica Geller,5,6,3,5
"Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!",Rachel Green,5,6,3,7
Arghhhh!!!!!!,Rachel Green,5,6,3,9
Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!,Monica Geller,5,6,3,11
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.,Phoebe Buffay,5,6,4,2

That might work!,Phoebe Buffay,5,6,4,4
"Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think?",Joey Tribbiani,5,6,4,5
You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.,Chandler Bing,5,6,4,6
"No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye.",Ross Geller,5,6,4,7
What's the matter Ross?,Joey Tribbiani,5,6,4,8
"Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!",Ross Geller,5,6,4,9
Why?,Phoebe Buffay,5,6,4,10
"Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.",Ross Geller,5,6,4,11
That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!,Joey Tribbiani,5,6,4,12
So you're really okay with this?,Chandler Bing,5,6,4,13
"Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!",Ross Geller,5,6,4,14
"Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.",Chandler Bing,5,6,4,15
"Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!!",Joey Tribbiani,5,6,4,17
You guys! You guys!,Rachel Green,5,6,4,19
"We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!",Monica Geller,5,6,4,20
"It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!",Rachel Green,5,6,4,21
"And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!",Monica Geller,5,6,4,22
"Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!",Rachel Green,5,6,4,23
"Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?",Joey Tribbiani,5,6,4,24
Yeah!,Rachel Green,5,6,4,25
"Yeah, you fogged Danny.",Joey Tribbiani,5,6,4,26

"Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!",Rachel Green,5,6,6,8
"Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.",Monica Geller,5,6,6,9
"What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!",Rachel Green,5,6,6,10
"This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.",Phoebe Buffay,5,6,6,11

"Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice...",Ross Geller,5,6,7,11
"You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!",Joey Tribbiani,5,6,7,12
Why?,Ross Geller,5,6,7,13
"It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.",Joey Tribbiani,5,6,7,14
What's going on?,Ross Geller,5,6,7,15
We all hate Emily!,Joey Tribbiani,5,6,7,16
Nooo!!,Phoebe Buffay,5,6,7,17

"Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.",Chandler Bing,5,6,7,20
Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!,Joey Tribbiani,5,6,7,21
"Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!",Ross Geller,5,6,7,22
I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.,Phoebe Buffay,5,6,7,23
"God, I feel so guilty about Ross.",Monica Geller,5,6,8,2
"Oh, I know.",Phoebe Buffay,5,6,8,3

Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.,Chandler Bing,5,6,8,6
"Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!",Joey Tribbiani,5,6,8,7
"Well, I think it's very brave what you said.",Chandler Bing,5,6,8,8
"All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.",Phoebe Buffay,5,6,8,10
"Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?",Chandler Bing,5,6,8,11
"Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!",Phoebe Buffay,5,6,8,12
Hi!,Rachel Green,5,6,9,2

"Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.",Rachel Green,5,6,9,14
And stop saying that! I hate that!,Rachel Green,5,6,9,16
Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?,Rachel Green,5,6,9,19
What?!,Rachel Green,5,6,9,21
Okay. Okay.,Rachel Green,5,6,9,23
"Uh, Ross?",Chandler Bing,5,6,10,2

"Oh good! Because we have an ""I'm sorry"" song.",Phoebe Buffay,5,6,10,5
Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.,Ross Geller,5,6,10,6
"Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.",Joey Tribbiani,5,6,10,7
"Yeah, we are so sorry.",Chandler Bing,5,6,10,8
You're kinda stepping on the song.,Phoebe Buffay,5,6,10,9
"Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.",Joey Tribbiani,5,6,10,10
"Whatever you decide, whatever you do.",Monica Geller,5,6,10,11
"Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!",Phoebe Buffay,5,6,10,12
"Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.",Ross Geller,5,6,10,13

"Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.",Joey Tribbiani,5,6,11,2
"You do, huh?",Ross Geller,5,6,11,3
"Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone...",Joey Tribbiani,5,6,11,4
What are you talking about?,Ross Geller,5,6,11,5
I'm not sure.,Joey Tribbiani,5,6,11,6
Hi!,Rachel Green,5,6,11,7

That yeti is one smooth talker.,Rachel Green,5,6,11,11
"I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.",Monica Geller,5,6,11,12
"Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.",Rachel Green,5,6,11,13
"Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really... I don't mind.",Rachel Green,5,6,11,15
Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.,Ross Geller,5,6,11,16

Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?,Monica Geller,5,7,3,11

But what?,Monica Geller,5,15,2,25
She keeps punching me.,Joey Tribbiani,5,15,2,26
"In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?",Monica Geller,5,15,2,28
"Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me.",Joey Tribbiani,5,15,2,29
"I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?",Monica Geller,5,15,2,30
"Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.",Chandler Bing,5,15,2,31
"Aww, Joey, come here. Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?",Rachel Green,5,15,2,32
Hey!,Ross Geller,5,15,3,2

Huh.,Ross Geller,5,15,3,6
"Bread, so you never go hungry.",Phoebe Buffay,5,15,3,7

Oh that's nice.,Ross Geller,5,15,3,22
Oh. Uhh...,Ross Geller,5,15,3,24
"No-no, it's not that, it's just... I-I just moved in.",Ross Geller,5,15,3,26
"Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.",Ross Geller,5,15,3,28
"No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.",Ross Geller,5,15,3,30
"Yes but too me he's just, man.",Ross Geller,5,15,3,32
"Ugh, can you believe that guy!",Ross Geller,5,15,3,34
Yeah. I really like his glasses.,Phoebe Buffay,5,15,3,35
"...so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.",Ross Geller,5,15,4,2
Sounds like a fun party.,Chandler Bing,5,15,4,3
"Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.",Rachel Green,5,15,4,4
It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!,Ross Geller,5,15,4,5
"Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.",Rachel Green,5,15,4,6
"Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.",Ross Geller,5,15,4,7
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.,Rachel Green,5,15,4,8
"Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.",Chandler Bing,5,15,4,9
"Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.",Rachel Green,5,15,4,10
Wh-wh-why?!,Chandler Bing,5,15,4,11
"Well, because she loves you and because you love her.",Rachel Green,5,15,4,12
"Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!",Chandler Bing,5,15,4,13
"Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.",Rachel Green,5,15,4,14
"I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?",Chandler Bing,5,15,4,15
"No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.",Rachel Green,5,15,4,16
"Okay. It's not different at all, is it?",Chandler Bing,5,15,4,17
Not unless different means the same.,Rachel Green,5,15,4,18
"Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.",Joey Tribbiani,5,15,5,3
"Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.",Joey Tribbiani,5,15,5,5
Isn't this great?,Monica Geller,5,15,6,2
Hmm.,Chandler Bing,5,15,6,3
Couldn't you just stay like this forever? Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?,Monica Geller,5,15,6,4
"Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.",Chandler Bing,5,15,6,5
Are you okay?,Monica Geller,5,15,6,6
"Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.",Chandler Bing,5,15,6,7
What-what are you doing?,Monica Geller,5,15,6,8
"I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.",Chandler Bing,5,15,6,9
"Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!",Monica Geller,5,15,6,10
What?!,Chandler Bing,5,15,6,11
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.,Monica Geller,5,15,6,12
"Well, you do want all that stuff, right?",Chandler Bing,5,15,6,13
Oh and you know what I want!,Monica Geller,5,15,6,14
Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!,Chandler Bing,5,15,6,15
I do not have baby fever!,Monica Geller,5,15,6,16
"Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!",Chandler Bing,5,15,6,17
"Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!",Monica Geller,5,15,6,18
Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!,Chandler Bing,5,15,6,19
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!,Monica Geller,5,15,6,20
"Well, I did not know that.",Chandler Bing,5,15,6,21
"It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.",Chandler Bing,5,15,7,2
By me?,Chandler Bing,5,15,7,4
"Oh, no!",Ross Geller,5,15,7,5
No-no.,Joey Tribbiani,5,15,7,6
"Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.",Ross Geller,5,15,7,7
"Yeah, big!",Joey Tribbiani,5,15,7,8
"Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.",Joey Tribbiani,5,15,7,10
"Gunther, can I get a coffee to go?",Monica Geller,5,15,7,11
Monica.,Chandler Bing,5,15,7,12
I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.,Monica Geller,5,15,7,13
Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.,Chandler Bing,5,15,7,14
What?!,Monica Geller,5,15,7,15
"Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.",Chandler Bing,5,15,7,16
"Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.",Monica Geller,5,15,7,17
Phoebe!,Ross Geller,5,15,8,3
"Oh, hi Ross!",Phoebe Buffay,5,15,8,4
What are you doing?,Ross Geller,5,15,8,5
"Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out it's a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!",Phoebe Buffay,5,15,8,6
You chipped in?!,Ross Geller,5,15,8,8
"Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.",Phoebe Buffay,5,15,8,9
Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!,Ross Geller,5,15,8,10
"Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.",Phoebe Buffay,5,15,8,11
"Yeah, but you're making me look bad!",Ross Geller,5,15,8,12
No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!,Phoebe Buffay,5,15,8,13
Hey!,Phoebe Buffay,5,15,8,15
"Yeah, okay, my bad.",Phoebe Buffay,5,15,8,18
Hey!,Joey Tribbiani,5,15,9,2
"Hi! Wow! You look, you look...big.",Rachel Green,5,15,9,3
"Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?",Joey Tribbiani,5,15,9,4
"Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.",Rachel Green,5,15,9,5
"Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?",Joey Tribbiani,5,15,9,6
Hey! Hiya!,Joey Tribbiani,5,15,9,8
"Hey! Hey, cute jacket!",Rachel Green,5,15,9,9
Oh! Ow!,Rachel Green,5,15,9,11
Whoa! Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.,Rachel Green,5,15,9,13
"Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!",Rachel Green,5,15,9,15
"Ohh, you're so sweet!",Rachel Green,5,15,9,17
Huh.,Joey Tribbiani,5,15,9,19
Uhh....,Joey Tribbiani,5,15,9,21
Nah.,Joey Tribbiani,5,15,9,23
Phoebe?,Ross Geller,5,15,10,2
That's what I'm saying.,Phoebe Buffay,5,15,10,3
Phoebe? Phoebe?,Ross Geller,5,15,10,4
Ooh.,Phoebe Buffay,5,15,10,5
"Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?",Ross Geller,5,15,10,6
"No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?",Phoebe Buffay,5,15,10,7
"So uh, what did you tell them about me?",Ross Geller,5,15,10,9
"Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.",Phoebe Buffay,5,15,10,10
Ohh.,Ross Geller,5,15,10,11
But somehow you came off as the bad guy.,Phoebe Buffay,5,15,10,12
What?!,Ross Geller,5,15,10,13
"Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.",Phoebe Buffay,5,15,10,14
"Ohh, this cake is really good!",Ross Geller,5,15,10,15
"Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!",Phoebe Buffay,5,15,10,16
"All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, ""Who hear likes Ross,"" and he's wearing two nametags! I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.",Phoebe Buffay,5,15,10,25
"Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.",Phoebe Buffay,5,15,11,2
"Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.",Ross Geller,5,15,11,3
Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?,Chandler Bing,5,15,12,2
I'm Monica.,Monica Geller,5,15,12,3
"I need to talk to you, it's urgent!",Chandler Bing,5,15,12,4
Okay.,Monica Geller,5,15,12,5
"Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.",Chandler Bing,5,15,12,6
Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!,Monica Geller,5,15,12,7
Monica...,Chandler Bing,5,15,12,8
"No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!",Monica Geller,5,15,12,9
Will you marry me?,Chandler Bing,5,15,12,10
Oh-no. No. No.,Ross Geller,5,15,12,12
What a bad idea!,Joey Tribbiani,5,15,12,13
"Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!",Rachel Green,5,15,12,14
"Chandler, why are you doing this?",Monica Geller,5,15,12,15
I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.,Chandler Bing,5,15,12,16
Chandler.,Monica Geller,5,15,12,17
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?,Chandler Bing,5,15,12,18
"Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?",Monica Geller,5,15,12,19
"No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?",Chandler Bing,5,15,12,20
"Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.",Monica Geller,5,15,12,21
"Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.",Chandler Bing,5,15,12,22
Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!,Monica Geller,5,15,12,23
"Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.",Chandler Bing,5,15,12,24
Who? Two divorces and Joey?!,Monica Geller,5,15,12,25
Hey!,Ross Geller,5,15,12,26
She's right y'know.,Joey Tribbiani,5,15,12,27
"Yeah, but still, cheap shot!",Ross Geller,5,15,12,28
"Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.",Monica Geller,5,15,12,29
I didn't think I was!,Chandler Bing,5,15,12,30
"Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?",Monica Geller,5,15,12,32
"Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.",Chandler Bing,5,15,12,33
"Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?",Joey Tribbiani,5,15,13,2
"No, I will not!",Ross Geller,5,15,13,3
"Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.",Joey Tribbiani,5,15,13,4
"You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?",Ross Geller,5,15,13,5
"Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.",Phoebe Buffay,5,15,13,7
"Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?",Rachel Green,5,15,13,8
"Okay, how long is this going to go on.",Chandler Bing,5,15,13,9
"Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.",Monica Geller,5,15,13,10
"This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole ""We were on a break thing?"" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?",Ross Geller,5,15,13,11
That's not funny.,Chandler Bing,5,15,13,12
That's not funny at all!,Joey Tribbiani,5,15,13,13
Hey!,Joey Tribbiani,5,16,1,2
Hey!,Chandler Bing,5,16,1,3
Hey!,Monica Geller,5,16,1,4
What are you guys doing up?,Joey Tribbiani,5,16,1,5
"Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?",Chandler Bing,5,16,1,6
Dark red.,Joey Tribbiani,5,16,1,7
"Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later. Hey, how about maroon?",Chandler Bing,5,16,1,8
"Yes, you are so smart!",Monica Geller,5,16,1,9
"Aww, you guys are so cute!",Joey Tribbiani,5,16,1,10

"All right, I'll see you in the morning.",Joey Tribbiani,5,16,1,12
"Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!",Monica Geller,5,16,2,2
"Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.",Joey Tribbiani,5,16,2,3
"Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but...",Monica Geller,5,16,2,4

Yes! You are so smart! I love you.,Monica Geller,5,16,2,6
I love you too.,Joey Tribbiani,5,16,2,7
"Uhh, we still need a tip.",Rachel Green,5,16,3,2
All right. Hold on. I got it. Nickel! How much more do we need?,Phoebe Buffay,5,16,3,3
A couple of bucks.,Rachel Green,5,16,3,4
"Okay, dime! You guys should probably keep talking; this could take a while. Oh no, wait! Look it! Whoa! Oh my God, this is a police badge!",Phoebe Buffay,5,16,3,5
Wow!,Monica Geller,5,16,3,6
"Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.",Chandler Bing,5,16,3,7
"Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.",Rachel Green,5,16,3,8
"Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!",Phoebe Buffay,5,16,3,9
"Hey, you guys!",Joey Tribbiani,5,16,3,10
Hey!,Chandler Bing,5,16,3,11

"Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?",Joey Tribbiani,5,16,3,14
"Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?",Monica Geller,5,16,3,15
"Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I'm not him.",Joey Tribbiani,5,16,3,16
"I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.",Monica Geller,5,16,3,17
No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!,Joey Tribbiani,5,16,3,18
Are you saying I smell bad?,Monica Geller,5,16,3,19
"No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry.",Joey Tribbiani,5,16,3,20
What's with him?,Monica Geller,5,16,3,21
"Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.",Chandler Bing,5,16,3,22
Ugh!,Rachel Green,5,16,4,2
"Yeah, I still don't know. I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says, ""Kids welcome here."" But that also says, ""Come here to me!""",Ross Geller,5,16,4,3
What?! You say that to kids?!!,Rachel Green,5,16,4,4
"No! No! No! The ""Come here to me"" is y'know for the ladies.",Ross Geller,5,16,4,5
"Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.",Rachel Green,5,16,4,6
Yeah?,Ross Geller,5,16,4,8
"Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!",Ross Geller,5,16,4,10
"Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!",Rachel Green,5,16,4,11
"Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you! All right Rach, let's go!",Ross Geller,5,16,4,12

"Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together.",Ross Geller,5,16,4,18
Ross!,Rachel Green,5,16,4,20
What's that supposed to mean?,Ross Geller,5,16,4,21
Ross!,Rachel Green,5,16,4,22
"Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.",Ross Geller,5,16,4,24
Yeah! Rach?,Ross Geller,5,16,4,26
"Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.",Rachel Green,5,16,4,27
Then tell him quickly.,Ross Geller,5,16,4,28
Fine! We went out.,Rachel Green,5,16,4,29
"Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!",Ross Geller,5,16,4,30

"Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!",Phoebe Buffay,5,16,5,16

"Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!",Monica Geller,5,16,7,3
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.,Phoebe Buffay,5,16,7,4
"Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.",Chandler Bing,5,16,7,5
"You could get arrested, right now! All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power.",Phoebe Buffay,5,16,7,6
Hey.,Phoebe Buffay,5,16,7,7

"Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!",Chandler Bing,5,16,7,15
"All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it.",Joey Tribbiani,5,16,7,16
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.,Chandler Bing,5,16,7,17
"Well, it involved Monica.",Joey Tribbiani,5,16,7,18

It-it doesn't?,Joey Tribbiani,5,16,7,24

That kinda sounds like your dream dude.,Joey Tribbiani,5,16,7,27
"Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.",Monica Geller,5,16,7,28

"Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!",Monica Geller,5,16,7,34
"No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?",Joey Tribbiani,5,16,7,35

"Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great...",Joey Tribbiani,5,16,9,10

I'll treat you real nice.,Joey Tribbiani,5,16,9,16
"Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!",Rachel Green,5,16,9,17
Won't-won't that take longer?,Joey Tribbiani,5,16,9,18

What?! Why?!,Rachel Green,5,16,11,9
"Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!",Joey Tribbiani,5,16,11,10

I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.

"This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.",Ross Geller,5,19,2,23

That's not good.,Phoebe Buffay,5,19,3,4
"No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!",Joey Tribbiani,5,19,3,5
"Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.",Rachel Green,5,19,3,6
"If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?",Chandler Bing,5,19,3,7
"Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!",Joey Tribbiani,5,19,3,9
"No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.",Joey Tribbiani,5,19,3,11
"Doesn't know, ""Hello."" But she knows Capricorn One.",Chandler Bing,5,19,3,13
"Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.",Monica Geller,5,19,3,15
But I already gave them back to you!,Phoebe Buffay,5,19,3,16

"Chandler! Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.",Monica Geller,5,19,3,34
"Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.",Chandler Bing,5,19,3,35
"Go on, teach me something about men and women.",Monica Geller,5,19,3,36
"Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, ""I'm just flirting, no big deal."" But the guy is thinking, ""Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!""",Chandler Bing,5,19,3,37
No way!,Monica Geller,5,19,3,38
It's true.,Chandler Bing,5,19,3,39
Well that's pathetic!,Monica Geller,5,19,3,40
Again true.,Chandler Bing,5,19,3,41
And this goes for all guys?,Monica Geller,5,19,3,42

"Hey uh, y'know that smell gas has?",Ross Geller,5,19,3,91

"Ohh, thank God! Finally!",Rachel Green,5,20,2,4
"Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?",Monica Geller,5,20,2,5

Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.,Chandler Bing,5,20,3,22
Did I say you could smell it?!,Joey Tribbiani,5,20,3,23
I can't smell your sandwich?,Chandler Bing,5,20,3,24
Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!,Joey Tribbiani,5,20,3,25
"Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?",Chandler Bing,5,20,3,26
"Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.",Joey Tribbiani,5,20,3,27

"Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?!",Rachel Green,5,20,4,2
Rach! It's me! Pick up!,Monica Geller,5,20,4,3

"I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.",Monica Geller,5,20,4,6
So all we have is ice?,Rachel Green,5,20,4,7
See if he has ice.,Monica Geller,5,20,4,8
Okay.,Rachel Green,5,20,4,9
Oh. Oh!,Rachel Green,5,20,4,12
So where are we going next?,Ross Geller,5,20,5,2
"Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?",Chandler Bing,5,20,5,4
"Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?",Joey Tribbiani,5,20,5,5
"Yeah, no one talks like that!",Ross Geller,5,20,5,7
Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!,Joey Tribbiani,5,20,5,8
"Hey, I'm more cop than you two!",Ross Geller,5,20,5,9
How do you figure that?,Chandler Bing,5,20,5,10
"Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!",Ross Geller,5,20,5,11
"Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.",Chandler Bing,5,20,5,12
"Umm, jealous!",Ross Geller,5,20,5,13
"Yeah, no problem.",Ross Geller,5,20,5,15
"Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!",Ross Geller,5,20,5,17
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.,Chandler Bing,5,20,5,20
"Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?",Joey Tribbiani,5,20,5,21
Nooo!,Monica Geller,5,20,6,3
I know!,Rachel Green,5,20,6,4
"Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!",Monica Geller,5,20,6,5
What?! We can't do that!,Rachel Green,5,20,6,6
"We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?",Monica Geller,5,20,6,7
Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!,Rachel Green,5,20,6,8
"I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?",Monica Geller,5,20,6,9
I don't think he's the one who needs help.,Rachel Green,5,20,6,10
"No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.",Monica Geller,5,20,6,12
Ugh!,Rachel Green,5,20,6,13
"Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.",Monica Geller,5,20,6,14
"Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!",Rachel Green,5,20,6,15
Noooooooo!,Rachel Green,5,20,6,17
"Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!",Chandler Bing,5,20,7,2
What is it?,Ross Geller,5,20,7,4
"Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.",Chandler Bing,5,20,7,6
What? What? What? What is it?,Ross Geller,5,20,7,8
Is everything okay?,Joey Tribbiani,5,20,7,9
What's going on?,Chandler Bing,5,20,7,10
You okay man?,Joey Tribbiani,5,20,7,14
Uh-huh. Thank Joey!,Ross Geller,5,20,7,15

"All right, I guess we should go.",Monica Geller,5,20,8,2
"No, wait. Wait.",Rachel Green,5,20,8,3
Oh yeah right!,Monica Geller,5,20,8,4
"No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!",Rachel Green,5,20,8,5
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!,Monica Geller,5,20,8,6
Yeah well unless we tell him.,Rachel Green,5,20,8,7
"Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.",Monica Geller,5,20,8,8
"Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.",Rachel Green,5,20,8,10
"Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!",Ross Geller,5,20,8,11
Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!,Monica Geller,5,20,8,12
Right?,Rachel Green,5,20,8,13
John Glenn is here?!,Phoebe Buffay,5,20,9,3
"Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car...",Ross Geller,5,20,9,5
Hi!,Phoebe Buffay,5,20,9,7
"Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!",Ross Geller,5,20,9,9
"My God, Joey!",Phoebe Buffay,5,20,9,10
It was a car backfire!,Chandler Bing,5,20,9,11
"Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!",Ross Geller,5,20,9,12
"Yeah, I didn't know that.",Joey Tribbiani,5,20,9,13
And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.,Ross Geller,5,20,9,14
Who jumps at loud noises!,Chandler Bing,5,20,9,16
Wow! I could've died tonight.,Ross Geller,5,20,9,17
"Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.",Chandler Bing,5,20,9,18
I do have a newfound respect for life.,Ross Geller,5,20,9,19
Oh my God!,Chandler Bing,5,20,9,20
"Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.",Phoebe Buffay,5,20,9,22
Okay!,Phoebe Buffay,5,20,9,24
Bye!,Phoebe Buffay,5,20,9,26
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!,Joey Tribbiani,5,20,9,29
Dude! How come you took off?,Joey Tribbiani,5,20,10,2
"Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever...",Chandler Bing,5,20,10,3
Is something wrong?,Joey Tribbiani,5,20,10,4
"No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.",Chandler Bing,5,20,10,5
Okay.,Joey Tribbiani,5,20,10,6
You dove in front of Ross! Ross!,Chandler Bing,5,20,10,7
"That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!",Joey Tribbiani,5,20,10,8
I do not hate Ross!,Chandler Bing,5,20,10,9
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.,Joey Tribbiani,5,20,10,10
What picture?,Chandler Bing,5,20,10,11
"I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!",Joey Tribbiani,5,20,10,12
"Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!",Chandler Bing,5,20,10,13
"Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!",Joey Tribbiani,5,20,10,14
"When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.",Chandler Bing,5,20,10,15
"Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.",Joey Tribbiani,5,20,10,16
From a bullet!,Chandler Bing,5,20,10,17
I know it doesn't make much sense...,Joey Tribbiani,5,20,10,18
Much sense?!,Chandler Bing,5,20,10,19
"Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!",Joey Tribbiani,5,20,10,20
"So you risked your life, for a sandwich!",Chandler Bing,5,20,10,21
"I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!",Joey Tribbiani,5,20,10,22
"So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.",Chandler Bing,5,20,10,23
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!,Joey Tribbiani,5,20,10,24
Really?!,Chandler Bing,5,20,10,25
"Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.",Joey Tribbiani,5,20,10,26
Thanks.,Chandler Bing,5,20,10,27
"No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!",Joey Tribbiani,5,20,10,28
How good is that?,Joey Tribbiani,5,20,10,30
"Oh-oi-ho, yeah!",Chandler Bing,5,20,10,31
See?,Joey Tribbiani,5,20,10,32
Hm-hmm.,Chandler Bing,5,20,10,33
"Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!",Joey Tribbiani,5,20,10,34
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.,Chandler Bing,5,20,10,35
Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!,Joey Tribbiani,5,20,10,36
Hey! Hi!,Rachel Green,5,20,11,2
"Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?",Ross Geller,5,20,11,3
"Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!",Rachel Green,5,20,11,4
"Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!",Ross Geller,5,20,11,5
"Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?",Rachel Green,5,20,11,6
The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!,Ross Geller,5,20,11,7
What?! What? What happened?!,Rachel Green,5,20,11,8
"Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?",Ross Geller,5,20,11,9
Yeah!,Rachel Green,5,20,11,10
And somebody took a shot at me!,Ross Geller,5,20,11,11
Really?!,Rachel Green,5,20,11,12
"No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I...I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.",Ross Geller,5,20,11,13
Because a car backfired?,Rachel Green,5,20,11,14
"Okay, why are you here?",Ross Geller,5,20,11,15
"Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole ""seizing"" thing but um, Emily called you today.",Rachel Green,5,20,11,16
You talked to her?,Ross Geller,5,20,11,17
"No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine.",Rachel Green,5,20,11,18
"Well, okay, what-what did she say?",Ross Geller,5,20,11,19
"Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.",Rachel Green,5,20,11,20
Wow!,Ross Geller,5,20,11,21
"Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?",Rachel Green,5,20,11,22
"Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!",Ross Geller,5,20,11,23
"Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because-I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision.",Rachel Green,5,20,11,24
"Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.",Ross Geller,5,20,11,25
"Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?",Rachel Green,5,20,11,26
"Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!",Ross Geller,5,20,11,27
"Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!",Rachel Green,5,20,11,28
"You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?",Ross Geller,5,20,11,29
"Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.",Rachel Green,5,20,11,30
Huh.,Ross Geller,5,20,11,31
"I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?",Rachel Green,5,20,11,32
"That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.",Ross Geller,5,20,11,33
"Well, there you go!",Rachel Green,5,20,11,34
"Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.",Ross Geller,5,20,11,35
Close call day.,Rachel Green,5,20,11,36
"Hey, thanks Rach.",Ross Geller,5,20,11,37
"Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.",Rachel Green,5,20,11,38
Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.,Ross Geller,5,20,11,39
Oh?,Rachel Green,5,20,11,40
"""Hey Ross, it's you!"" Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.",Ross Geller,5,20,11,42
No.,Rachel Green,5,20,11,43
"Hey umm, was-was Monica here?",Ross Geller,5,20,11,44
Yeah.,Rachel Green,5,20,11,45
"Yeah, I want my money back.",Ross Geller,5,20,11,46
"Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?",Rachel Green,5,20,11,47
"Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?",Ross Geller,5,20,12,2
"Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.",Phoebe Buffay,5,20,12,3
"I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.",Ross Geller,5,20,12,4
"Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.",Monica Geller,5,20,12,5
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?,Chandler Bing,5,20,12,6
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.,Ross Geller,5,20,12,7
"Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.",Chandler Bing,5,20,12,8
"Yeah, hero sandwiches.",Joey Tribbiani,5,20,12,9
"Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey.",Phoebe Buffay,5,20,12,10
"I'm fine, thanks.",Phoebe Buffay,5,21,1,3
"Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?",Chandler Bing,5,21,1,4
No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.,Monica Geller,5,21,1,5
Okay.,Chandler Bing,5,21,1,6
Hiya doin' pumpkin?,Chandler Bing,5,21,1,8
Nope.,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,1,9
"So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?",Monica Geller,5,21,1,11
Oh my God!,Monica Geller,5,21,1,13
I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?,Monica Geller,5,21,1,15
"I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...",Monica Geller,5,21,1,17
Okay. Bye!,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,1,19
"So, what movie should we see?",Phoebe Buffay,5,21,1,21
Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!,Monica Geller,5,21,1,22
What?! Really?!,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,1,23
"He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!",Monica Geller,5,21,1,24
I can't believe this!,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,1,25
"Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!",Chandler Bing,5,21,1,26
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!,Monica Geller,5,21,1,27
"Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!",Chandler Bing,5,21,1,28
"No, but it is fast. Isn't it?",Phoebe Buffay,5,21,1,29
Ohhhh!,Monica Geller,5,21,1,30
"No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!",Phoebe Buffay,5,21,1,31
"So, what are you gonna do?",Chandler Bing,5,21,1,32
I don't know. I'll just handle it-I'll ask you to talk to him!,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,1,33
Me?! Why me?,Chandler Bing,5,21,1,34
"Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!",Phoebe Buffay,5,21,1,35
"I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.",Chandler Bing,5,21,1,36
That is so sweet!,Monica Geller,5,21,1,37
"Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.",Chandler Bing,5,21,1,38
"Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?",Joey Tribbiani,5,21,2,2
"Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.",Ross Geller,5,21,2,3
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.,Joey Tribbiani,5,21,2,4
Also an island.,Ross Geller,5,21,2,5
"Hey, what time is it?",Joey Tribbiani,5,21,2,7
2:17.,Ross Geller,5,21,2,8
"Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?",Joey Tribbiani,5,21,2,9
Are you serious?!,Ross Geller,5,21,2,10
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.,Joey Tribbiani,5,21,2,11
Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!,Ross Geller,5,21,2,12
"Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!",Joey Tribbiani,5,21,2,13
"Hey, you guys...",Rachel Green,5,21,2,14
Hey!,Joey Tribbiani,5,21,2,15
Is Monica here?,Rachel Green,5,21,2,16
"All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.",Rachel Green,5,21,2,18
You bought Shawn Cassidy!,Ross Geller,5,21,2,19
"Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?",Rachel Green,5,21,2,20
Okay! Check it out!,Rachel Green,5,21,2,22
What-what is it?!,Ross Geller,5,21,2,24

"It's a, it's a cat!",Rachel Green,5,21,2,26
"That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}",Joey Tribbiani,5,21,2,27
Yes it is!,Rachel Green,5,21,2,28
Why is it inside out?!,Ross Geller,5,21,2,29
"Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!",Rachel Green,5,21,2,30

"Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}",Ross Geller,5,21,2,38
It's not a cat!,Joey Tribbiani,5,21,2,39
"Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!",Rachel Green,5,21,2,40

"Uhh, the ball thing.",Joey Tribbiani,5,21,2,43

"Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!",Ross Geller,5,21,2,46
Okay!,Joey Tribbiani,5,21,2,47

You mean scared.,Chandler Bing,5,21,3,12
Scared? Happy?,Chandler Bing,5,21,3,14
"I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!",Chandler Bing,5,21,3,16
"Were you're parents happy, or something?",Chandler Bing,5,21,3,18
"Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.",Chandler Bing,5,21,3,20
"Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!",Chandler Bing,5,21,3,22
"Yeah, you're right about that.",Chandler Bing,5,21,3,24
...now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!,Ross Geller,5,21,4,2
Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.,Joey Tribbiani,5,21,4,4
Hey guys!,Monica Geller,5,21,4,6

"Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.",Joey Tribbiani,5,21,4,34
Yeah.,Ross Geller,5,21,4,35
"You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, ""Rachel!""",Rachel Green,5,21,4,36
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.,Ross Geller,5,21,4,37
What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!,Monica Geller,5,21,4,38
"Well, I was gonna let you play with it.",Rachel Green,5,21,4,39

"Yes I did, and I think you should do it.",Chandler Bing,5,21,5,4
What?!,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,5,5
"He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.",Chandler Bing,5,21,5,6
You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,5,7
"I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.",Chandler Bing,5,21,5,8
"Ohh!! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing.",Phoebe Buffay,5,21,5,9

Thanks! Okay.,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,5,15
Yeah?,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,5,17
Uh-hmm.,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,5,19
"No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this.",Phoebe Buffay,5,21,5,21
Yeah?,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,5,23
That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,5,25
I just-I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,5,27
I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just-I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,5,29
Which is why my answer is yes!,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,5,31
Uh-huh! I'm so...happy.,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,5,33

He's a dropper!,Monica Geller,5,21,6,8
"Oh yeah, that's right!",Joey Tribbiani,5,21,6,9
I'm not a dropper!,Chandler Bing,5,21,6,10
"It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?",Ross Geller,5,21,6,11
It's throwing and catching!,Chandler Bing,5,21,6,12
All right.,Ross Geller,5,21,6,13
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.,Chandler Bing,5,21,6,14
"Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!",Joey Tribbiani,5,21,6,16
Oh my-Oh good God!,Monica Geller,5,21,6,17
"I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!",Rachel Green,5,21,6,18
"Baking it didn't help, huh?",Ross Geller,5,21,6,19
"So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?",Monica Geller,5,21,6,20
I tried! They won't take her back.,Rachel Green,5,21,6,21
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.,Chandler Bing,5,21,6,22
"Rach, why won't they take it back?",Monica Geller,5,21,6,23
"Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?",Rachel Green,5,21,6,24
"Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.",Monica Geller,5,21,6,25
"No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!",Rachel Green,5,21,6,26
"Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.",Monica Geller,5,21,6,28
"Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.",Chandler Bing,5,21,6,29
We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,6,33
"I know, I'm so excited!",Phoebe Buffay,5,21,6,35

"Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!",Phoebe Buffay,5,21,6,39
So you're moving in with him. What happened?,Monica Geller,5,21,6,42
"I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.",Phoebe Buffay,5,21,6,43
"Why, do you write him a lot?",Monica Geller,5,21,6,44
"No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?",Phoebe Buffay,5,21,6,45
"Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.",Phoebe Buffay,5,21,6,48
"No, nothing.",Phoebe Buffay,5,21,7,3
Yeah.,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,7,5
"No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool.",Phoebe Buffay,5,21,7,7
Uh-huh!,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,7,9
"Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.",Phoebe Buffay,5,21,7,12
"Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. Can I get some water?",Phoebe Buffay,5,21,7,14
"Umm, yeah! Today's.",Phoebe Buffay,5,21,7,16

Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry!,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,7,20
Yeah?,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,7,22
That's so sweet.,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,7,24
Living with you would make me happy.,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,7,26
"No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!",Phoebe Buffay,5,21,7,28
Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!,Phoebe Buffay,5,21,7,30

"Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.",Rachel Green,5,21,8,13
"Okay, a thousand.",Rachel Green,5,21,8,15
"Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.",Rachel Green,5,21,8,17
"Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! Damnit! Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?",Rachel Green,5,21,8,19
I'm starving!,Ross Geller,5,21,9,2

"No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.",Rachel Green,6,1,10,5
I don't know if it's true.,Ross Geller,6,1,10,6
Oh b-b-but it is!,Rachel Green,6,1,10,7

"Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.",Joey Tribbiani,6,1,11,9
You can still sleep at night and stuff.,Phoebe Buffay,6,1,11,10

Then all your stuff would be here.,Monica Geller,6,1,12,13
"Well, what if all my stuff was here?",Chandler Bing,6,1,12,14
"Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.",Monica Geller,6,1,12,15
Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?,Chandler Bing,6,1,12,16

"Don't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.",Phoebe Buffay,6,2,1,25

"Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?",Monica Geller,6,2,2,5
"No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, ""Joey, I have too..."" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""...go to the bathroom."" He may think I'm sick.",Chandler Bing,6,2,2,6
"Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.",Monica Geller,6,2,2,7

"Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!",Phoebe Buffay,6,2,3,21
"Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody's stairs!",Ross Geller,6,2,3,22
"Ross, it's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates...",Phoebe Buffay,6,2,3,23
"No! No, I won't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.",Ross Geller,6,2,3,24
"Ross, you're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!",Phoebe Buffay,6,2,3,25
Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?,Ross Geller,6,2,3,26
"Y'know that's really fair. Y'know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I'll show you! Come here.",Phoebe Buffay,6,2,3,27
What?! Why?,Ross Geller,6,2,3,28
"Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?",Phoebe Buffay,6,2,3,30
"And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross.",Ross Geller,6,2,3,31

"Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!",Monica Geller,6,2,4,3
What gave me away?,Chandler Bing,6,2,4,4
"I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!",Monica Geller,6,2,4,5
"Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?",Chandler Bing,6,2,4,6

"Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.",Rachel Green,6,2,4,12
"Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.",Chandler Bing,6,2,4,13
"I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!",Rachel Green,6,2,4,14
"Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty...",Chandler Bing,6,2,4,15
What?,Rachel Green,6,2,4,16

"And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!",Rachel Green,6,2,4,21
"Yes, we are.",Monica Geller,6,2,4,22
"And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.",Rachel Green,6,2,4,23
Rach...,Chandler Bing,6,2,4,24
"Yeah, he's gonna work on that.",Monica Geller,6,2,4,25
Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door...,Rachel Green,6,2,4,26
We'll be waiting for you...,Monica Geller,6,2,4,27
"...once you know the stories, it's not that bad. First marriage, wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada's fault.",Ross Geller,6,2,5,2
"Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn't be interested? Who wouldn't want to date him?",Phoebe Buffay,6,2,5,3
"Okay, what about you? Wouldn't you want a date?",Phoebe Buffay,6,2,5,5
Whatever! What about you Meg?,Phoebe Buffay,6,2,5,7
What?!,Ross Geller,6,2,5,9
"She said, ""He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.""",Phoebe Buffay,6,2,5,10
"This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?",Ross Geller,6,2,5,11
"Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.",Phoebe Buffay,6,2,5,12
"We were drunk! I would've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!",Ross Geller,6,2,5,13
Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!,Phoebe Buffay,6,2,5,14
"Look, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don't want to be divorced three times.",Ross Geller,6,2,5,15
"Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, ""Well done!"" Bravo Meg.",Phoebe Buffay,6,2,5,16
"Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!",Ross Geller,6,2,5,17
"Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?",Chandler Bing,6,2,6,2
"Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!",Monica Geller,6,2,6,3
"Well, Joey's my best friend.",Chandler Bing,6,2,6,4
I'm not your best friend?,Monica Geller,6,2,6,5
You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?,Chandler Bing,6,2,6,6
"All right, all right, at least I'm prepared.",Monica Geller,6,2,6,7
Okay. Oh yes.,Chandler Bing,6,2,6,8
Hey!,Monica Geller,6,2,6,9
Hey-hey!,Chandler Bing,6,2,6,10

"Okay, bye!",Chandler Bing,6,2,6,14
"Rach, there's something uh, important I have to tell you.",Monica Geller,6,2,6,15
Are you pregnant?!,Rachel Green,6,2,6,16
"No! But, I'm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.",Monica Geller,6,2,6,17
Um-hmm.,Rachel Green,6,2,6,18
"Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.",Monica Geller,6,2,6,19
"Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that.",Rachel Green,6,2,6,20
"Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.",Monica Geller,6,2,6,21
Okay.,Rachel Green,6,2,6,22
Okay. Don't you want a cookie?,Monica Geller,6,2,6,23
Sure? Thanks.,Rachel Green,6,2,6,24
"Maybe, do you need a tissue?",Monica Geller,6,2,6,25
"Monica, where did you get these?!",Rachel Green,6,2,6,27
I made them!,Monica Geller,6,2,6,28
"Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!",Rachel Green,6,2,6,29
"God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. ""You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?"" ""Can't, its not there.""",Joey Tribbiani,6,2,7,2
"Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.",Chandler Bing,6,2,7,3
Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.,Joey Tribbiani,6,2,7,4
Not once did we do that.,Chandler Bing,6,2,7,5
Hi.,Monica Geller,6,2,7,6
Hey!,Chandler Bing,6,2,7,7
Hi.,Joey Tribbiani,6,2,7,8
"So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.",Monica Geller,6,2,7,9
"Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?",Chandler Bing,6,2,7,10
"Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.",Monica Geller,6,2,7,11
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?,Chandler Bing,6,2,7,12
"I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!",Monica Geller,6,2,7,13
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!,Joey Tribbiani,6,2,7,14
"Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!",Chandler Bing,6,2,7,15
Yes.,Ross Geller,6,2,8,3
"Yes, second in two years. Third overall.",Ross Geller,6,2,8,5
"Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk...",Ross Geller,6,2,8,7
"Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.",Ross Geller,6,2,8,9
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.,Ross Geller,6,2,8,11
I think just the annulment for today.,Ross Geller,6,2,8,13
Easy.,Ross Geller,6,2,8,15
No problem.,Ross Geller,6,2,8,17
"Ooh! There's no way to do this without her? 'Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.",Ross Geller,6,2,8,19
"Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy.",Ross Geller,6,2,8,21
Hey!,Rachel Green,6,2,9,2
"Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.",Monica Geller,6,2,9,3
Okay!,Rachel Green,6,2,9,4
"Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.",Monica Geller,6,2,9,5
Okay.,Rachel Green,6,2,9,6
"Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!",Monica Geller,6,2,9,7
What the hell is that?,Rachel Green,6,2,9,8
"I don't know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.",Monica Geller,6,2,9,9
"Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!",Rachel Green,6,2,9,10
Something to remember me by!,Monica Geller,6,2,9,11
"Mon, honey you're not dying. I'm just moving out. Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time.",Rachel Green,6,2,9,12
"But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!",Monica Geller,6,2,9,13
Are you okay? You're not blinking.,Rachel Green,6,2,9,14
"I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.",Monica Geller,6,2,9,15
"Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.",Rachel Green,6,2,9,16
"An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!",Monica Geller,6,2,9,17
What is the matter with you?!,Rachel Green,6,2,9,18
What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!,Monica Geller,6,2,9,19
"All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.",Rachel Green,6,2,9,20
What's hard to believe?,Monica Geller,6,2,9,21
"Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.",Rachel Green,6,2,9,22
"Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.",Monica Geller,6,2,9,23
But I...,Rachel Green,6,2,9,24
"No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.",Monica Geller,6,2,9,25
It is? Really?,Rachel Green,6,2,9,26
"Yeah, sweetie.",Monica Geller,6,2,9,27
"I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?",Rachel Green,6,2,9,28
No.,Monica Geller,6,2,9,29
What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!,Rachel Green,6,2,9,30
I'm gonna miss you!,Monica Geller,6,2,9,31
I mean it's the end of an era!,Rachel Green,6,2,9,32
I know!,Monica Geller,6,2,9,33
"Okay, bye!",Phoebe Buffay,6,2,10,2
Oh no.,Ross Geller,6,2,10,3
So? Did you get the annulment?,Phoebe Buffay,6,2,10,4
I couldn't.,Ross Geller,6,2,10,5
I knew it! Because you love Rachel.,Phoebe Buffay,6,2,10,6
It's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I...,Ross Geller,6,2,10,7
"Yeah, complicated 'cause of the love.",Phoebe Buffay,6,2,10,8
"I... I do, I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?",Ross Geller,6,2,10,9
I've never been more convinced of your love for her.,Phoebe Buffay,6,2,10,10
I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?!,Ross Geller,6,2,10,11
"Ohh, what's wrong?!",Ross Geller,6,2,10,13
Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.,Rachel Green,6,2,10,14
Oh my-Come here! Come here! It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.,Ross Geller,6,2,10,15
Thank you.,Rachel Green,6,2,10,16
Of course.,Ross Geller,6,2,10,17
"So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?",Joey Tribbiani,6,2,11,2
"Oh we do, but not just yet.",Phoebe Buffay,6,2,11,3
"Really?! Well, when?",Joey Tribbiani,6,2,11,4
"Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won't work out.",Phoebe Buffay,6,2,11,5
Wow.,Joey Tribbiani,6,2,11,6
"I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.",Phoebe Buffay,6,2,11,7
Great!,Joey Tribbiani,6,2,11,8
But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.,Phoebe Buffay,6,2,11,9
"Oh-oh, what about Ross?",Joey Tribbiani,6,2,11,10
"I don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.",Phoebe Buffay,6,2,11,11
Hey!,Chandler Bing,6,3,1,2
Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!,Phoebe Buffay,6,3,1,3
Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!,Joey Tribbiani,6,3,1,5
"Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.",Rachel Green,6,3,1,6
"Uh-huh, what?",Phoebe Buffay,6,3,1,7
Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful...,Rachel Green,6,3,1,8
Oh!,Phoebe Buffay,6,3,1,9
...how about I move in with you?,Rachel Green,6,3,1,10
"Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?",Phoebe Buffay,6,3,1,11
Who's Denise?,Monica Geller,6,3,1,12
My roommate.,Phoebe Buffay,6,3,1,13
You have a roommate?!,Rachel Green,6,3,1,14
"Yes, Denise. Denise!",Phoebe Buffay,6,3,1,15
"Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?",Joey Tribbiani,6,3,1,16
"Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?",Chandler Bing,6,3,1,17
Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!,Phoebe Buffay,6,3,1,18
"Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place...",Joey Tribbiani,6,3,1,19
"Oh, that's true.",Rachel Green,6,3,1,20
"Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?",Joey Tribbiani,6,3,1,21
"Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.",Rachel Green,6,3,1,22
Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!,Chandler Bing,6,3,1,23
Hey.,Phoebe Buffay,6,3,2,2
Hey!,Ross Geller,6,3,2,3
"So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?",Phoebe Buffay,6,3,2,4
"Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.",Ross Geller,6,3,2,5
You didn't tell her did you?,Phoebe Buffay,6,3,2,6
No.,Ross Geller,6,3,2,7
"Of course not, because you're in love with her.",Phoebe Buffay,6,3,2,8
"I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn't tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.",Ross Geller,6,3,2,9
"What do you mean, comforted her?",Phoebe Buffay,6,3,2,10
"It's nothing, I just gave her a hug.",Ross Geller,6,3,2,11
"Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!",Phoebe Buffay,6,3,2,12
It's also a sign of friendship.,Ross Geller,6,3,2,13
"Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.",Phoebe Buffay,6,3,2,14
It was a hug!,Ross Geller,6,3,2,15
"Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?",Phoebe Buffay,6,3,2,16
S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?,Ross Geller,6,3,2,17
"Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist.",Phoebe Buffay,6,3,2,18
"I was hugging her as a friend. It's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh...coconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!",Ross Geller,6,3,2,19
"Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.",Phoebe Buffay,6,3,2,20
"If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!",Ross Geller,6,3,2,21
"Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's 'cause you were speaking the secret language of love!",Phoebe Buffay,6,3,2,22
"Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you.",Joey Tribbiani,6,3,3,2
Who was it?,Chandler Bing,6,3,3,3
"I don't know! How about, ""Thanks for taking the message."" Jeez!",Joey Tribbiani,6,3,3,4
"Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?",Monica Geller,6,3,3,5
Sure!,Chandler Bing,6,3,3,6
"Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.",Monica Geller,6,3,3,7
"Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!",Chandler Bing,6,3,3,8
No.,Monica Geller,6,3,3,9
"Okay so you mean no as in, ""Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely.""",Chandler Bing,6,3,3,10
"Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.",Monica Geller,6,3,3,11
"So, that's it?",Chandler Bing,6,3,3,12
I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.,Monica Geller,6,3,3,13
Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!,Chandler Bing,6,3,3,14
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?,Monica Geller,6,3,3,15
"I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!",Chandler Bing,6,3,3,16
Are you mocking me?,Monica Geller,6,3,3,17
"No, I'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room.",Chandler Bing,6,3,3,18
"Hey, what's up?",Joey Tribbiani,6,3,4,2
"Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.",Chandler Bing,6,3,4,3
"But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.",Joey Tribbiani,6,3,4,4
"""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" Nice!",Chandler Bing,6,3,4,5
"Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!",Joey Tribbiani,6,3,4,6
"Pheebs, I have to ask you...",Rachel Green,6,3,5,2
Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.,Phoebe Buffay,6,3,5,3
You're just staring into space.,Rachel Green,6,3,5,4
"Umm, I'm trying to move that pencil.",Phoebe Buffay,6,3,5,5
This one?,Rachel Green,6,3,5,6
It worked!,Phoebe Buffay,6,3,5,7
"Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; ""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" It's just, there is nothing! The city's full!",Rachel Green,6,3,5,8
"Wait, no, look at this! ""Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay..."" Oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor.",Phoebe Buffay,6,3,5,9
Hey!,Ross Geller,6,3,5,10
Hey.,Rachel Green,6,3,5,11
"Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?",Ross Geller,6,3,5,12
Yeah! Why?,Rachel Green,6,3,5,13
"Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?",Ross Geller,6,3,5,14
That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!,Rachel Green,6,3,5,15
"Don't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here's Warren's number.",Ross Geller,6,3,5,16
"Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you!",Rachel Green,6,3,5,17
"Okay, you go grab it!",Ross Geller,6,3,5,19
I saw it.,Phoebe Buffay,6,3,5,20
I don't know what you're talking about.,Ross Geller,6,3,5,21
"Umm, I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. You love her again; you re-love her!",Phoebe Buffay,6,3,5,22
"Look, I do not re-love her.",Ross Geller,6,3,5,23
"I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.",Phoebe Buffay,6,3,5,24
"Look, we're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?",Ross Geller,6,3,5,25
"Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.",Rachel Green,6,3,5,26
You can live with me.,Ross Geller,6,3,5,27
What?!,Rachel Green,6,3,5,28
What?!,Phoebe Buffay,6,3,5,29
What?,Ross Geller,6,3,5,30
Oh my God! Are you serious?!,Rachel Green,6,3,6,2
Uh-huh.,Ross Geller,6,3,6,3
I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!,Rachel Green,6,3,6,4
"Well, I'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out.",Ross Geller,6,3,6,5
"Wow! I'm-I'm so happy for you guys. This is so-so, not stupid.",Phoebe Buffay,6,3,6,6
"Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You're my hero!",Rachel Green,6,3,6,7
"Hero, I uh, I don't know-well, all right.",Ross Geller,6,3,6,8
"Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!",Rachel Green,6,3,6,9
"Oh please! You're gonna say things now, aren't ya?",Ross Geller,6,3,6,10
"No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that's how she ended up living with me! Okay, that's a lie.",Phoebe Buffay,6,3,6,11
Hi.,Chandler Bing,6,3,7,2
Hi.,Monica Geller,6,3,7,3
"Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can 'em-Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women...",Chandler Bing,6,3,7,4
Stop it Chandler. I'm sorry too.,Monica Geller,6,3,7,5
Really?,Chandler Bing,6,3,7,6
Yeah! Oh yes!,Monica Geller,6,3,7,7
Ohh.,Chandler Bing,6,3,7,8
"Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.",Monica Geller,6,3,7,9
That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.,Chandler Bing,6,3,7,10
Totally!,Monica Geller,6,3,7,11
We don't have to come up with this now.,Chandler Bing,6,3,7,13
Oh good.,Monica Geller,6,3,7,14
"Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?",Chandler Bing,6,3,7,15
Changes?,Monica Geller,6,3,7,16
"Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.",Chandler Bing,6,3,7,17
You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?,Monica Geller,6,3,7,18
Is that a problem?,Chandler Bing,6,3,7,19
"Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together.",Monica Geller,6,3,7,20
"Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.",Chandler Bing,6,3,7,21
See now-now you're taking them away from their home.,Monica Geller,6,3,7,22
"Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!",Chandler Bing,6,3,7,23
"Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!",Monica Geller,6,3,7,24
In the game room!,Chandler Bing,6,3,7,25
Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!,Monica Geller,6,3,7,26
All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!,Chandler Bing,6,3,7,27
"Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",Joey Tribbiani,6,3,8,2
"Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?",Joey Tribbiani,6,3,8,4
You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.,Chandler Bing,6,3,8,5
"Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.",Joey Tribbiani,6,3,8,6
Why did you take the shower curtain down?,Chandler Bing,6,3,8,7
That thing was a hazard! I'm very safety conscious.,Joey Tribbiani,6,3,8,8
Hey!,Rachel Green,6,3,9,2
"Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.",Ross Geller,6,3,9,3
"Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.",Rachel Green,6,3,9,4
"What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?",Ross Geller,6,3,9,5
"No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.",Rachel Green,6,3,9,6
What?! Over a stupid room!,Ross Geller,6,3,9,7
"Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!",Rachel Green,6,3,9,8
"Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!",Ross Geller,6,3,9,9
"What's all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!",Ross Geller,6,3,10,2
"Ross, we can handle this.",Monica Geller,6,3,10,3
"Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!",Ross Geller,6,3,10,4
"Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!",Chandler Bing,6,3,10,5
"Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?",Ross Geller,6,3,10,6
"Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.",Chandler Bing,6,3,10,7
Love is the best medicine.,Monica Geller,6,3,10,8
That's laughter.,Chandler Bing,6,3,10,9
Why do you do it?,Monica Geller,6,3,10,10
I don't know.,Chandler Bing,6,3,10,11
"Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?",Ross Geller,6,3,10,12
"Yeah, I do.",Chandler Bing,6,3,10,13
"And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don't ya?",Ross Geller,6,3,10,14
Yes.,Monica Geller,6,3,10,15

"No-no, I'm staying put.",Rachel Green,6,3,11,3
"Why, where are you going?",Rachel Green,6,3,11,5
Hey Rach!,Ross Geller,6,3,11,7
Hi!,Rachel Green,6,3,11,8
"You're never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That's great news right-I mean for them. Right?",Ross Geller,6,3,11,9
Oh wow.,Rachel Green,6,3,11,10
"Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.",Ross Geller,6,3,11,11
"Yeah. Y'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird?",Rachel Green,6,3,11,12
"Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?",Ross Geller,6,3,11,13
"Well, because of us! Because of our history.",Rachel Green,6,3,11,14
No!,Ross Geller,6,3,11,15
No?,Rachel Green,6,3,11,16
"No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?",Ross Geller,6,3,11,17
No! Not at all!,Rachel Green,6,3,11,18
Good! Me neither! So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.,Ross Geller,6,3,11,19
"Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.",Rachel Green,6,3,11,20
Really?! We are?,Ross Geller,6,3,11,21
"Yeah! I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend...",Rachel Green,6,3,11,22
Ohh! That would be great.,Ross Geller,6,3,11,23
"But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, ""Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky.""",Rachel Green,6,3,11,24
"Yeah, I didn't think of that.",Ross Geller,6,3,11,25
So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!,Ross Geller,6,3,12,2
That's very funny!,Monica Geller,6,3,12,4
"He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!",Chandler Bing,6,3,12,5
"No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!",Ross Geller,6,3,12,6
"Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.",Monica Geller,6,3,12,7
"Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!",Ross Geller,6,3,12,8
"Yeah, I'm not so worried.",Chandler Bing,6,3,12,9
"Yeah, no, me neither.",Monica Geller,6,3,12,10
"Fine! It's your life! I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. DON'T DO IT!!!!!",Ross Geller,6,3,12,11
You still want to move in together right?,Monica Geller,6,3,12,12
Of course!,Chandler Bing,6,3,12,13
Ross didn't scare you?,Monica Geller,6,3,12,14
Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.,Chandler Bing,6,3,12,15
"Come here, I want to show you something!",Monica Geller,6,3,12,16
Okay!,Chandler Bing,6,3,12,17
Oh my God! Someone's killed Square Man!,Chandler Bing,6,3,12,19
This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.,Monica Geller,6,3,12,20
Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!,Chandler Bing,6,3,12,21
Okay!,Monica Geller,6,3,12,22
"Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say ""Merge?""",Chandler Bing,6,3,12,23
Uh-hmm.,Monica Geller,6,3,12,24
"Y'know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that's you and I together! Merge!",Chandler Bing,6,3,12,25
Oh my God! I love that!,Monica Geller,6,3,12,26
Really?!,Chandler Bing,6,3,12,27
"Uh, no!!",Monica Geller,6,3,12,28

"Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.",Phoebe Buffay,6,3,13,4
"So umm, where are the other guys?",Ross Geller,6,3,13,5
"Umm, well let's see Monica and Chandler are occupied.",Rachel Green,6,3,13,6

"No, the other thing. I really think it's great they work things out.",Rachel Green,6,3,13,8
"Yeah. There's no breaking them up, is there?",Ross Geller,6,3,13,9
"Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?",Rachel Green,6,3,13,10
Sure! Here.,Ross Geller,6,3,13,11
"Thank you. Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.",Rachel Green,6,3,13,12
"Yeah, I'm-I'm sure. Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind.",Ross Geller,6,3,13,13
"Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?",Joey Tribbiani,6,3,13,14
I've been back and forth.,Ross Geller,6,3,13,15
"Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! Back together!",Joey Tribbiani,6,3,13,16
"Ehh, I don't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.",Ross Geller,6,3,13,17
"That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, ""Oh that's okay. You'll find someone."" And then, bamn! She finds you!",Joey Tribbiani,6,3,13,18
"Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right.",Ross Geller,6,3,13,19
"I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?",Joey Tribbiani,6,3,13,20
Is that what I want?,Ross Geller,6,3,13,21
Yes.,Phoebe Buffay,6,3,13,22
"Here she comes. Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier.",Joey Tribbiani,6,3,13,24
"All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.",Rachel Green,6,3,13,25

"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!",Ross Geller,6,3,13,27
"No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!",Joey Tribbiani,6,3,13,28
"Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's.",Rachel Green,6,3,13,29

I'm doing okay. I think it's going well. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking to fast?,Phoebe Buffay,6,5,5,3
"Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it's going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.",Monica Geller,6,5,5,4
"Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. Do you know what Pheebs? When you're done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.",Chandler Bing,6,5,5,5
"Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.",Phoebe Buffay,6,5,5,6
See that's where I think that you're wrong. We've been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.,Chandler Bing,6,5,5,7
What do you mean?,Monica Geller,6,5,5,8
"I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y'know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around...",Chandler Bing,6,5,5,9
"That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.",Phoebe Buffay,6,5,5,10
"Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.",Chandler Bing,6,5,5,11
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.,Monica Geller,6,5,5,13
Yeah? Well this is not what I ordered.,Phoebe Buffay,6,5,5,14
Hey guys!,Joey Tribbiani,6,5,5,15
Hey!,Chandler Bing,6,5,5,16
Hey!,Phoebe Buffay,6,5,5,17
"Hey babies! Oh, I'm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!",Joey Tribbiani,6,5,5,18
Shocking! Since you still have the keys.,Chandler Bing,6,5,5,19
"You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.",Joey Tribbiani,6,5,5,20
What equity investments?,Chandler Bing,6,5,5,21
"The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?",Joey Tribbiani,6,5,5,22
"Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.",Monica Geller,6,5,5,23
You don't even have a car!,Chandler Bing,6,5,5,24
"I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.",Monica Geller,6,5,5,25
And?,Chandler Bing,6,5,5,26
And six others.,Monica Geller,6,5,5,27
There you are.,Chandler Bing,6,5,5,28
"Yeah, she tops out at 130.",Joey Tribbiani,6,5,6,2
And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.,Joey Tribbiani,6,5,6,4
Sure!,Joey Tribbiani,6,5,6,6
"Okay, take it easy.",Joey Tribbiani,6,5,6,8
"Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.",Joey Tribbiani,6,5,6,10
"Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up.",Joey Tribbiani,6,5,6,12
"Yeah, but it's my wax.",Joey Tribbiani,6,5,6,14
"Sure. Here. I'll uh, save your parking spot.",Joey Tribbiani,6,5,6,16
Why not?,Joey Tribbiani,6,5,6,18
"Yeah, so did I.",Joey Tribbiani,6,5,6,20
I don't know why I was so nervous about this. And I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.,Phoebe Buffay,6,5,7,2
"Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that's the same.",Monica Geller,6,5,7,3
"Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog!",Chandler Bing,6,5,7,4
"Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone's eye out!",Monica Geller,6,5,7,5
He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!,Chandler Bing,6,5,7,6
"No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that's just gonna mess them up.",Phoebe Buffay,6,5,7,7
"They're not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!",Chandler Bing,6,5,7,8
What?!,Phoebe Buffay,6,5,7,9
"Glass, sand, whatever.",Chandler Bing,6,5,7,10
"Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.",Phoebe Buffay,6,5,7,11
Oh it's so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.,Monica Geller,6,5,7,12
"Oh, I can still do that.",Phoebe Buffay,6,5,7,13
How are you still single?!,Monica Geller,6,5,7,14
All right. I thought about it and maybe you're right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.,Chandler Bing,6,5,7,15
Good. What made you change your mind?,Monica Geller,6,5,7,16
I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.,Chandler Bing,6,5,7,17
How did that happen?!!,Phoebe Buffay,6,5,7,18
"Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y'know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it's lodged in my throat.",Chandler Bing,6,5,7,19
"Damnit! Y'know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!",Monica Geller,6,5,7,20
"Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.",Rachel Green,6,5,8,3
"Fine, I'm mentally unstable.",Ross Geller,6,5,8,5
What?!,Ross Geller,6,5,8,7
"Uh yes, heroin and crack.",Rachel Green,6,5,8,8
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug!,Ross Geller,6,5,8,9
"Well, you would know.",Rachel Green,6,5,8,10
"Oh, come on!",Ross Geller,6,5,8,12
"Ross, please, I found the magazines!",Rachel Green,6,5,8,13
"Okay, I'm sorry, this is insane! I-I-I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now!",Ross Geller,6,5,8,15
And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!,Ross Geller,6,5,8,17
Ugh!,Rachel Green,6,5,8,18
"Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! And could you strike ""Consummated like bunnies"" from the record?",Rachel Green,6,5,8,20
"Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.",Rachel Green,6,5,8,22
"That's great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!",Ross Geller,6,5,8,24
What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!,Rachel Green,6,5,8,25
And what--What are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We don't get the annulment. Don't type that! What?! Stop typing! Hey! Stop typing! Stop typing! Stop typing!!,Ross Geller,6,5,8,26
"Okay, do you see, do you see what you're keeping me married too?!",Rachel Green,6,5,8,27
"All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!",Rachel Green,6,5,8,29
Yeah!,Ross Geller,6,5,8,30
And thank you for your time.,Rachel Green,6,5,8,32
So the Porsche guy took his car back.,Joey Tribbiani,6,5,9,2
But you found the keys to his clothes?,Chandler Bing,6,5,9,3
"No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.",Joey Tribbiani,6,5,9,4
And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?,Monica Geller,6,5,9,5
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?,Joey Tribbiani,6,5,9,6
That is true.,Chandler Bing,6,5,9,7
"Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.",Phoebe Buffay,6,5,9,8
"Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.",Joey Tribbiani,6,5,9,9
"Joey, you know you don't actually have one.",Monica Geller,6,5,9,10
Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!,Joey Tribbiani,6,5,9,11
"Ahh, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.",Chandler Bing,6,5,9,12
"All right, that's it, we're going to the emergency room.",Monica Geller,6,5,9,13
"What?! No, you can't, you can't leave me here with them! We're baby-sitting!",Phoebe Buffay,6,5,9,14
"The babies are asleep, I'm sure you'll be okay on your own for a while!",Monica Geller,6,5,9,15
But you-you can't leave me with them! We-we're a team! We're playing a zone! They're gonna triple team me!,Phoebe Buffay,6,5,9,16
"He's got something plastic lodged in his throat, we've got to go to the hospital.",Monica Geller,6,5,9,17
"But no, because a doctor won't be able to help him, it's just gonna y'know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.",Phoebe Buffay,6,5,9,18
I think that's gum.,Chandler Bing,6,5,9,19
I'm pretty sure it's gun.,Phoebe Buffay,6,5,9,20
"Okay, listen this really hurts. Let's go.",Chandler Bing,6,5,9,21
"A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital! No! What would, what would Krog do?",Phoebe Buffay,6,5,9,22
Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?,Joey Tribbiani,6,5,10,2
Porsche.,Joey Tribbiani,6,5,10,4
This is totally your fault!,Rachel Green,6,5,10,6
My fault?! You threatened the judge!,Ross Geller,6,5,10,7
"Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine!!",Rachel Green,6,5,10,8
That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!,Ross Geller,6,5,10,9
Hi! How are the Gellers?,Joey Tribbiani,6,5,10,10
Don't call us that!,Rachel Green,6,5,10,11
The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?,Ross Geller,6,5,10,12
Hey! It's Porsche!!,Joey Tribbiani,6,5,10,13
"Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as, ""Yeah, I do!"" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, I'll set you up with a clean one. Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? 'Cause let's face it, we're at Monica's. I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way that goes. Okay, good. Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! Oh, you're a lot mischievous! Well, it'll dry. Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now-who aren't there!",Phoebe Buffay,6,5,11,2
Hey!,Chandler Bing,6,5,11,3
How do you feel?,Phoebe Buffay,6,5,11,4
"Well, let's just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.",Chandler Bing,6,5,11,5
"Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed 'em, bathed 'em, and put 'em to bed.",Phoebe Buffay,6,5,11,6
And protected them from a tornado?,Chandler Bing,6,5,11,7
Oh my God.,Monica Geller,6,5,11,9
"I know, the babies are asleep.",Phoebe Buffay,6,5,11,10
"Phoebe, what, what happened here?!",Monica Geller,6,5,11,11
I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!,Phoebe Buffay,6,5,11,12
But my apartment!,Monica Geller,6,5,11,13
Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.,Chandler Bing,6,5,11,14
But the mess!,Monica Geller,6,5,11,15
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.,Chandler Bing,6,5,11,16
"You're right, you're right I shouldn't freak out. 'Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!",Monica Geller,6,5,11,17
"Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!",Chandler Bing,6,5,11,18
"Oh honey thank God you're home, I was getting worried.",Rachel Green,6,5,12,2
"I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I've already signed everything and I put little 'X's where you need to sign.",Ross Geller,6,5,12,3
"Oh, little 'X's! Great! That makes up for everything!",Rachel Green,6,5,12,4
"Y'know, I-I-you've done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?",Ross Geller,6,5,12,5
"Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!",Rachel Green,6,5,12,6
"Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!",Ross Geller,6,5,12,7
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!,Rachel Green,6,5,12,8
Yeah! Right!,Ross Geller,6,5,12,9
"You're right. That's very different. So let's, let's just sign the papers. All right? What?",Ross Geller,6,5,12,11
Nothing.,Rachel Green,6,5,12,12
"Okay, can we just sign please?",Ross Geller,6,5,12,13
Uh-hmm.,Rachel Green,6,5,12,14
Congratulations.,Ross Geller,6,5,12,15
"Okay Ross, we're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.",Rachel Green,6,5,12,16
What?,Ross Geller,6,5,12,17
"Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.",Rachel Green,6,5,12,18
Excuse me?,Ross Geller,6,5,12,19
"Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?",Rachel Green,6,5,12,20
Yeah?,Ross Geller,6,5,12,21
"And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.",Rachel Green,6,5,12,22
"So then if-if-I mean if you think about it, this is all your fault.",Ross Geller,6,5,12,23
"Yeah, don't push it though.",Rachel Green,6,5,12,24
"I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.",Ross Geller,6,5,12,25
"I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.",Rachel Green,6,5,12,26
"Did I, did I even treat?",Ross Geller,6,5,12,27
"No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.",Rachel Green,6,5,12,28
That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.,Ross Geller,6,5,12,29
"Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.",Rachel Green,6,5,12,30
"Eh, no problem.",Ross Geller,6,5,12,31
I'm gonna need a copy of those.,Rachel Green,6,5,12,33
Totally.,Ross Geller,6,5,12,34
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!,Joey Tribbiani,6,5,13,2

"Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.",Chandler Bing,6,6,1,2
Right! And when is that due?,Joey Tribbiani,6,6,1,3
First of the month.,Chandler Bing,6,6,1,4

"No, just the months you actually want to live here.",Chandler Bing,6,6,1,6
Ahhh.,Joey Tribbiani,6,6,1,7
"Okay, here is the phone bill.",Chandler Bing,6,6,1,8
Oh my God!!,Joey Tribbiani,6,6,1,9
"That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?",Chandler Bing,6,6,1,10
No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.,Joey Tribbiani,6,6,1,11
"It's not charity, Joe...",Chandler Bing,6,6,1,12
"No! Forget it! Okay-I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.",Joey Tribbiani,6,6,1,13
"Okay uh, here's the electric bill.",Chandler Bing,6,6,1,14
This is how much we pay for electric?!!!,Joey Tribbiani,6,6,1,15
"Uh, yeah.",Chandler Bing,6,6,1,16
"So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then?",Chandler Bing,6,6,1,18
So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?,Phoebe Buffay,6,6,2,2
"No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it.",Chandler Bing,6,6,2,3
"Well, how much do you think he needs?",Phoebe Buffay,6,6,2,4
"I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.",Chandler Bing,6,6,2,5
Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.,Phoebe Buffay,6,6,2,6
Well that would help the pride thing.,Chandler Bing,6,6,2,7
Hey!,Monica Geller,6,6,2,8
Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?,Chandler Bing,6,6,2,9
Okay.,Monica Geller,6,6,2,10
"Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?",Chandler Bing,6,6,2,11
"Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.",Monica Geller,6,6,2,12
"And also, my birthday.",Phoebe Buffay,6,6,2,13
It's not your birthday.,Monica Geller,6,6,2,14
What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it's not your birthday!,Phoebe Buffay,6,6,2,15
Hey!,Joey Tribbiani,6,6,2,17
Hey!,Ross Geller,6,6,2,18

"Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.",Ross Geller,6,6,2,22
"I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.",Joey Tribbiani,6,6,2,23
I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!,Ross Geller,6,6,2,24
"Pheebs, I was wondering...",Rachel Green,6,6,2,25
You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!,Monica Geller,6,6,2,26
Well and clearly not a minute sooner.,Rachel Green,6,6,2,27
"Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed.",Monica Geller,6,6,2,28

"Yeah, yeah, I know.",Rachel Green,6,6,2,33
"Well, what you're wearing is fine for that.",Phoebe Buffay,6,6,2,34
"Rachel, I need to borrow-You're not packed!!!! You're not packed even a little bit!",Monica Geller,6,6,2,35
Surprise!!,Rachel Green,6,6,2,36
What?,Monica Geller,6,6,2,37
"No, no don't get mad because look-this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, ""What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!"" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!",Rachel Green,6,6,2,38
"I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?",Monica Geller,6,6,2,39
I have plans.,Phoebe Buffay,6,6,2,40
You're plans were with us.,Monica Geller,6,6,2,41
That's right.,Phoebe Buffay,6,6,2,42

Okay.,Phoebe Buffay,6,6,2,44
"Okay! Oh my God, thank you!!",Monica Geller,6,6,2,45

"Yes, but for the last time.",Chandler Bing,6,6,2,51
"Okay fine, now Ross...",Monica Geller,6,6,2,52
"Oh, but-but I can't do it.",Ross Geller,6,6,2,53
Why not?,Monica Geller,6,6,2,54
I've got Ben.,Joey Tribbiani,6,6,2,55
"Because, because I've got Ben.",Ross Geller,6,6,2,56
"It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?",Monica Geller,6,6,2,57
He's at a dinner party.,Chandler Bing,6,6,2,58
Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!,Monica Geller,6,6,2,59
"Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?",Ross Geller,6,6,2,60
"All right, sorry.",Monica Geller,6,6,2,61
I gotta go make a fake Ben.,Ross Geller,6,6,2,62
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.,Joey Tribbiani,6,6,3,2
"Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.",Chandler Bing,6,6,3,3

"Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?",Chandler Bing,6,6,3,6
"What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.",Joey Tribbiani,6,6,3,7
Yes it would. What do you say to $50?,Chandler Bing,6,6,3,8
"Okay, you're on.",Joey Tribbiani,6,6,3,9

I guess you weren't there.,Rachel Green,6,6,4,6
"You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?",Phoebe Buffay,6,6,4,7
"I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.",Rachel Green,6,6,4,8
I'm gonna miss you so much.,Monica Geller,6,6,4,9
"Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. Y'know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss.",Phoebe Buffay,6,6,4,10
I don't think there's anything.,Monica Geller,6,6,4,11
"Come on, there's gotta be something.",Phoebe Buffay,6,6,4,12

Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.,Monica Geller,6,6,4,20
You get your messages!,Rachel Green,6,6,4,21
"Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.",Monica Geller,6,6,4,22
"So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?",Rachel Green,6,6,4,23

"Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!",Joey Tribbiani,6,6,12,14
When did I try to give you money?,Chandler Bing,6,6,12,15
"Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said ""No,"" you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!",Joey Tribbiani,6,6,12,16
I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.,Chandler Bing,6,6,12,17

"What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.",Chandler Bing,6,7,9,4
"Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.",Ross Geller,6,7,9,5
"OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.",Chandler Bing,6,7,9,6

"No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?",Joey Tribbiani,6,7,9,12
"Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.",Ross Geller,6,7,9,13
"Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?",Chandler Bing,6,7,9,14
"Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go ""ba dum bum chessh""",Ross Geller,6,7,9,15
"Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.",Chandler Bing,6,7,9,16
"Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.",Ross Geller,6,7,9,17
That's not specific to girls.,Chandler Bing,6,7,9,18
"This is great, this is great, what else, what else?",Joey Tribbiani,6,7,9,19
"Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.",Ross Geller,6,7,9,20
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.,Chandler Bing,6,7,9,21
They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.,Ross Geller,6,7,9,22
"Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.",Chandler Bing,6,7,9,23
I'm never gonna find love again.,Ross Geller,6,7,9,24

"Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.",Rachel Green,6,7,10,4
"So, what should you have done?",Phoebe Buffay,6,7,10,5
"Well, I-I should've told you the truth.",Rachel Green,6,7,10,6
"Uh-Huh, Which is...?",Phoebe Buffay,6,7,10,7
"Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...",Rachel Green,6,7,10,8

"Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.",Rachel Green,6,7,10,10
Why do you care?,Phoebe Buffay,6,7,10,11
Because they're people.,Rachel Green,6,7,10,12
But people that you don't know and will never see again.,Phoebe Buffay,6,7,10,13
"Yes, but still. They're people...with eyes.",Rachel Green,6,7,10,14
"Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.",Phoebe Buffay,6,7,10,15
"I-I am not uptight-Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.",Rachel Green,6,7,10,16
"That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog.",Phoebe Buffay,6,7,10,17
"Okay, is this lamp in the same place?",Chandler Bing,6,7,11,2
Who cares? I repel women.,Ross Geller,6,7,11,3

"Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.",Joey Tribbiani,6,7,12,5
"All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.",Joey Tribbiani,6,7,12,7
"No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?",Joey Tribbiani,6,7,12,9
Oh!,Joey Tribbiani,6,7,12,11

"Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.",Monica Geller,6,7,14,7
"Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",Chandler Bing,6,7,14,8
"It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?",Monica Geller,6,7,14,9
Do you want me to be afraid of you?,Chandler Bing,6,7,14,10
"Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.",Monica Geller,6,7,14,11

"That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.",Ross Geller,6,7,15,4
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!,Chandler Bing,6,7,15,6

That's weird. I don't think my boss likes me either.,Chandler Bing,6,8,2,24
I don't think mine likes me either.,Monica Geller,6,8,2,25
Maybe it's a universal thing?,Ross Geller,6,8,2,26
"Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.",Joey Tribbiani,6,8,2,27
Yeah let's head off to work.,Chandler Bing,6,8,2,28
We should go.,Monica Geller,6,8,2,29

"That-that is your make out buddy. Don't you recognize him? Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.",Rachel Green,6,8,6,33
That's not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.,Phoebe Buffay,6,8,6,34

"Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look anything like that guy. He's-he's young and he's got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.",Phoebe Buffay,6,8,6,36
"Oh My God, Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.",Rachel Green,6,8,6,37
What?,Phoebe Buffay,6,8,6,38
"Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!",Rachel Green,6,8,6,39
Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?,Phoebe Buffay,6,8,6,40
To get you to make out with him!!!,Rachel Green,6,8,6,41
Ohhh.,Phoebe Buffay,6,8,6,42
"Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.",Monica Geller,6,8,7,2
I don't know what I'm going to do. That date starts in like an hour.,Ross Geller,6,8,7,3
"Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright.",Monica Geller,6,8,7,4

"Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.",Monica Geller,6,8,8,4

"You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.",Monica Geller,6,8,8,6

"Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???",Chandler Bing,6,8,10,2
"Ohh, hi, Kim.",Rachel Green,6,8,11,2
"Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen.",Rachel Green,6,8,11,4
"Okay, two things didn't happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that's not true.",Rachel Green,6,8,11,6
No.,Rachel Green,6,8,11,8
"Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.",Rachel Green,6,8,11,10
I-I don't want your job. I-I don't. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don't even know how to use my keycard.,Rachel Green,6,8,11,12
Mmm-Hmm.,Ross Geller,6,8,12,3

"Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm.",Ross Geller,6,8,12,13
"So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.",Joey Tribbiani,6,8,13,2
"Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.",Monica Geller,6,8,13,3
"Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.",Chandler Bing,6,8,13,4
"Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.",Monica Geller,6,8,13,5
"Ohh, I love birds.",Joey Tribbiani,6,8,13,6
What is the matter with you ?!?,Chandler Bing,6,8,13,7
What?,Joey Tribbiani,6,8,13,8
"You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!",Chandler Bing,6,8,13,9
"Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.",Joey Tribbiani,6,8,13,10
You're turning into a women.,Chandler Bing,6,8,13,11
No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.,Joey Tribbiani,6,8,13,12
Now I've upset you? What did I say?,Chandler Bing,6,8,13,13
"It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!",Joey Tribbiani,6,8,13,14
"Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.",Rachel Green,6,8,14,2
But why didn't you just tell her the truth.,Phoebe Buffay,6,8,14,3
I did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.,Rachel Green,6,8,14,4
"Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?",Phoebe Buffay,6,8,14,5
"You were with Kenny today, weren't you?",Rachel Green,6,8,14,6

"Yeah, he dumped me. He said, ""Rachel, I can't do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful woman. I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry.""

"Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.",Joey Tribbiani,6,8,17,7

So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I'll see you then.,Monica Geller,6,9,1,15

"Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry.",Monica Geller,6,9,1,17
What? What? Why?!,Chandler Bing,6,9,1,18
"Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.",Monica Geller,6,9,1,19
Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?,Chandler Bing,6,9,1,20
"Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.",Monica Geller,6,9,1,21
"Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.",Chandler Bing,6,9,1,22
You really think that'll work?,Monica Geller,6,9,1,23
"Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?",Chandler Bing,6,9,1,24

W-What was the one right before bananas?,Ross Geller,6,9,3,74

"What about all that ""friends forever"" stuff?",Chandler Bing,6,9,4,9
"I don't know, I-I was all high.",Ross Geller,6,9,4,10
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!,Monica Geller,6,9,5,2
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!,Chandler Bing,6,9,5,3
"Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!",Monica Geller,6,9,5,4
"The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?",Chandler Bing,6,9,5,5
"Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?",Ross Geller,6,9,5,6
You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!,Monica Geller,6,9,5,7
"Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?",Ross Geller,6,9,5,8

I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.,Rachel Green,6,9,7,19
Eh?,Ross Geller,6,9,7,20
"I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y'know? And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.",Rachel Green,6,9,7,21
You're alone.,Ross Geller,6,9,7,22
"No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you're alone, alone. And I just-it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.",Rachel Green,6,9,7,23
"Ah well, can't blame a guy for trying!",Ross Geller,6,9,7,24

"Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?",Rachel Green,6,9,7,75

Hey,Ross Geller,6,10,1,5
"Wow, Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?",Ross Geller,6,10,1,7

That is nice and we're done. TADA!,Phoebe Buffay,6,10,1,9
"I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.",Chandler Bing,6,10,1,11
"Oh, here.",Monica Geller,6,10,1,12
See now it feels like Christmas!,Chandler Bing,6,10,1,14
"... and that's the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life's triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.",Ross Geller,6,10,2,2
"So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.",Rachel Green,6,10,2,3

Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!,Monica Geller,6,10,2,20
"Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside aren't you?",Chandler Bing,6,10,2,21
You're gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!,Ross Geller,6,10,2,23
Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.,Joey Tribbiani,6,10,2,25
"Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.",Ross Geller,6,10,2,27
Are you serious?,Ross Geller,6,10,2,29
We are there!,Monica Geller,6,10,2,30

What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!,Monica Geller,6,10,2,41
"Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.",Rachel Green,6,10,2,42
"Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'",Joey Tribbiani,6,10,2,43
"Well, that's a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.",Rachel Green,6,10,2,44
It was a dry day.,Ross Geller,6,10,2,45
We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rocking Eve!,Monica Geller,6,10,2,46

"Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?",Rachel Green,6,10,4,16
"No, I have a great idea for a present for her.",Chandler Bing,6,10,4,17
"Oh, that's it? A great idea!",Phoebe Buffay,6,10,4,18
"Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?",Rachel Green,6,10,4,19
"If I help, we can find 'em faster!",Chandler Bing,6,10,4,20
That's right!,Rachel Green,6,10,4,21

"Oh, it's a Macy's bag!",Rachel Green,6,10,4,24
"Ooh, who's it for?",Phoebe Buffay,6,10,4,26
"Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you.",Rachel Green,6,10,4,27

Yeah.,Rachel Green,6,10,4,31
"You don't, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?",Chandler Bing,6,10,4,32
"Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen!",Chandler Bing,6,10,4,35
"Okay, here comes another camera.",Monica Geller,6,10,5,2
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.,Ross Geller,6,10,5,3
Why do they keep doing that?,Ross Geller,6,10,5,5
"If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They've been taping those people up there all day.",Monica Geller,6,10,5,6
Right.,Ross Geller,6,10,5,7
"Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?",Ross Geller,6,10,5,9
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?,Monica Geller,6,10,5,11

"Ugh, those bastards! Let's go.",Rachel Green,6,11,11,9
That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!,Phoebe Buffay,6,11,11,10
"No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the... We don't have the...that lamp! And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.",Rachel Green,6,11,11,11
"Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!",Phoebe Buffay,6,11,11,12
"Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on don't be mad.",Rachel Green,6,11,11,13
"No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!",Phoebe Buffay,6,11,11,14
"Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.",Rachel Green,6,11,11,15
I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?,Phoebe Buffay,6,11,11,16
What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!,Rachel Green,6,11,11,17
But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?,Phoebe Buffay,6,11,11,18
Oh. Yes! I would so move out!,Rachel Green,6,11,11,19
Okay then I don't have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!,Phoebe Buffay,6,11,11,20
That's right!,Rachel Green,6,11,11,21
But at least the apothecary table is real.,Phoebe Buffay,6,11,11,23
"Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?",Joey Tribbiani,6,11,12,2
That's totally understandable.,Chandler Bing,6,11,12,4

"See? Eh, wasn't that fun?",Joey Tribbiani,6,11,12,13
"I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!",Monica Geller,6,11,12,15
"And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, ""Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment.""",Chandler Bing,6,11,12,16
All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!,Monica Geller,6,11,12,18

You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!,Monica Geller,6,11,12,21
"All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.",Joey Tribbiani,6,11,12,22
"I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset.",Joey Tribbiani,6,11,12,24
Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.,Joey Tribbiani,6,11,12,26

I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.,Monica Geller,6,11,13,6
"Well, when it's not right, you know it.",Joey Tribbiani,6,11,13,7
You okay?,Chandler Bing,6,11,13,8
Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.,Joey Tribbiani,6,11,13,9
Y'know what would cheer you up?,Ross Geller,6,11,13,10

"I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.",Ross Geller,6,11,13,12
You're right! That did cheer me up!,Joey Tribbiani,6,11,13,13
"Hey, you're not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!",Ross Geller,6,12,1,2
I didn't know Playboy prints jokes.,Phoebe Buffay,6,12,1,3
"Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It's not just about the pictures.",Ross Geller,6,12,1,4
"That didn't work on mom, it's not going to work on us.",Monica Geller,6,12,1,5
"Here, check it out. It's the first one, too.",Ross Geller,6,12,1,6
That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.,Chandler Bing,6,12,1,8
What?,Ross Geller,6,12,1,9
I made that joke up.,Chandler Bing,6,12,1,10
"Uh, oh-oh, no you didn't. I did.",Ross Geller,6,12,1,11
"Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.",Chandler Bing,6,12,1,12
"Hey, tell Dan, 'Thanks.'",Ross Geller,6,12,1,13

"I'm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.",Rachel Green,6,12,1,16
"Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?",Chandler Bing,6,12,1,17
No.,Monica Geller,6,12,1,18
Seriously?,Chandler Bing,6,12,1,19
"Well, you tell a lot of jokes!",Monica Geller,6,12,1,20
"Look, Chandler, it's my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don't print the name, so it doesn't really matter who gets credit, right?",Ross Geller,6,12,1,21
"Yeah, I guess.",Chandler Bing,6,12,1,22
Hey guys.,Joey Tribbiani,6,12,1,23

Let's go watch it at your place.,Joey Tribbiani,6,12,2,3
"Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.",Chandler Bing,6,12,2,4
"Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,2,5
"What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?",Chandler Bing,6,12,2,6
"No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know...",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,2,7
"Joey, why is your cable out?",Chandler Bing,6,12,2,8
"I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,2,9
"If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?",Chandler Bing,6,12,2,10
"No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,2,11

Hey.,Phoebe Buffay,6,12,3,2
It's only you.,Monica Geller,6,12,3,3
Wh-wh-what are you doing?,Phoebe Buffay,6,12,3,4
We are looking at a Playboy.,Rachel Green,6,12,3,5
"Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!",Phoebe Buffay,6,12,3,6
"So do you think that these pictures-Are, are they trying to tell a story?",Monica Geller,6,12,3,7
"Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, 'Where are they, where are they?'",Rachel Green,6,12,3,8
"Well, she's not going to find them lying in the grass like that.",Monica Geller,6,12,3,9
"Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?",Phoebe Buffay,6,12,3,11
"You see, now, I would date this girl. She's cute, she's outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that's got to come in handy",Rachel Green,6,12,3,13
"Okay, I've got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?",Monica Geller,6,12,3,14
I don't know.,Rachel Green,6,12,3,15
Me neither.,Monica Geller,6,12,3,16

What?!,Monica Geller,6,12,3,18
I don't know. Me neither.,Phoebe Buffay,6,12,3,19
You forget how many great songs Heart had.,Joey Tribbiani,6,12,4,2
Yeah.,Chandler Bing,6,12,4,3
"You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.",Ross Geller,6,12,4,4
"So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.",Chandler Bing,6,12,4,5
"Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,4,6
"What, you didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.",Ross Geller,6,12,4,7
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.,Chandler Bing,6,12,4,9
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.,Chandler Bing,6,12,4,11
"Your joke? Well, I think 'the Hef' would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.",Ross Geller,6,12,4,12
"So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.",Chandler Bing,6,12,4,13
"Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I'll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.",Ross Geller,6,12,4,14
"Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.",Chandler Bing,6,12,4,15
"Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?",Ross Geller,6,12,4,16
Yeah!,Chandler Bing,6,12,4,17
"Well, I'm not going to go now anyway .",Ross Geller,6,12,4,18
Okay .,Chandler Bing,6,12,4,19
"Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff.",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,4,22
"Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,4,24
What?!,Joey Tribbiani,6,12,4,26
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?,Joey Tribbiani,6,12,4,28
"She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.",Monica Geller,6,12,5,2
"He took my joke, he took it.",Chandler Bing,6,12,5,3
It's wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.,Monica Geller,6,12,5,4
"You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I'm going to get a joke journal. Y'know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.",Chandler Bing,6,12,5,5
That's a good idea.,Monica Geller,6,12,5,6
Yeah!,Chandler Bing,6,12,5,7
Do you know what's a bad idea?,Monica Geller,6,12,5,8
Picking Rachel.,Chandler Bing,6,12,5,9
That's right. Did you hear something?,Monica Geller,6,12,5,10
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.,Chandler Bing,6,12,5,11
It's coming from the living room.,Monica Geller,6,12,5,12
I finished my book.,Joey Tribbiani,6,12,5,14
"Hey, you guys.",Monica Geller,6,12,6,2
"Oh, don't you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.",Monica Geller,6,12,6,4
"Monica, what are you doing?",Rachel Green,6,12,6,5
"Nothing, I'm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.",Monica Geller,6,12,6,6
I guess it was kinda funny.,Phoebe Buffay,6,12,6,7
It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me?,Monica Geller,6,12,6,8
Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you're ... just ... kinda high maintenance-Okay let's go to lunch!,Phoebe Buffay,6,12,6,9
"That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!",Monica Geller,6,12,6,10
"No, okay, you're right. You're easy-going. You're just not as easy-going as Rachel. She's just more flexible and-and mellow. That's all.",Phoebe Buffay,6,12,6,11
"Well, people are different.",Rachel Green,6,12,6,12
"Ya, you know, Rachel ... she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.",Phoebe Buffay,6,12,6,13
"What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.",Rachel Green,6,12,6,14
"Oh, okay, you're not a pushover.",Phoebe Buffay,6,12,6,15
"Oh my ... you think I'm a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You're not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong, that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.",Rachel Green,6,12,6,16
You start working on that list.,Monica Geller,6,12,6,17
I cannot believe her.,Rachel Green,6,12,6,19
I know. Where do you wanna go eat?,Monica Geller,6,12,6,20
"Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.",Rachel Green,6,12,6,21
I'm sick of Japanese. We're not going there.,Monica Geller,6,12,6,22
"All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.",Rachel Green,6,12,6,23
All right.,Monica Geller,6,12,6,24
"Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.",Ross Geller,6,12,7,2
"Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, 'cause I'm heading up there.",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,7,6
"Uh, yeah, I'll take a coffee. Thanks, man.",Ross Geller,6,12,7,7

"Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.",Rachel Green,6,12,7,16
"Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,7,17
"Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,7,19
"Joey, do you work here?",Monica Geller,6,12,7,20
No.,Joey Tribbiani,6,12,7,21
Yeah?,Joey Tribbiani,6,12,7,23
"Joey, what's going on. What didn't you tell us you work here?",Monica Geller,6,12,8,2
"It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction.",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,8,3
So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.,Chandler Bing,6,12,8,4
"I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,8,5
"Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.",Rachel Green,6,12,8,6
"Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?",Ross Geller,6,12,8,7
"Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird.",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,8,8
"Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven't gotten it.",Ross Geller,6,12,8,9
"See, now it's weird again.",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,8,10
"I Think It's Great That You Work Here. You'Re Going To Make A Lot Of Money, And Here's Your First Tip. Don't eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.",Chandler Bing,6,12,8,11
"Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.",Rachel Green,6,12,8,12
"Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover.",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,8,13
"Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?",Ross Geller,6,12,8,14
"Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin.",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,8,15
Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.,Rachel Green,6,12,9,2
Okay.,Phoebe Buffay,6,12,9,3
"So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?",Monica Geller,6,12,9,4
"Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.",Rachel Green,6,12,9,5
Hah!,Monica Geller,6,12,9,6
"That true, I am flaky.",Phoebe Buffay,6,12,9,7
"So, what, you're just, you're just okay with being flaky?",Rachel Green,6,12,9,8
"Yeah, totally.",Phoebe Buffay,6,12,9,9
"Well, then, I'm okay with being high maintenance.",Monica Geller,6,12,9,10
"Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.",Rachel Green,6,12,9,11
That's great. Good for you guys.,Phoebe Buffay,6,12,9,12
I am not high maintenance!,Monica Geller,6,12,9,13
I am not a pushover!,Rachel Green,6,12,9,14
Who said you were?,Phoebe Buffay,6,12,9,15
"Oh, I'm flaky. I'll say anything.",Phoebe Buffay,6,12,9,17
"Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,10,2
"Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it's a great part. Look, check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. 'I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,10,4
"Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but ...",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,10,6
"Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,10,8
"No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,10,10
"So, you'd hire me, right?",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,10,12
"Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,10,14
"Yeah, it's for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it.",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,10,16
It's my joke.,Ross Geller,6,12,11,2
It's my joke.,Chandler Bing,6,12,11,3
"Y'know, I don't think we're going to settle this.",Ross Geller,6,12,11,5
Let's have Monica decide.,Chandler Bing,6,12,11,6
Yeah!,Ross Geller,6,12,11,7
Yeah!,Chandler Bing,6,12,11,8
Hey Mon.,Ross Geller,6,12,11,9
"Mon, get out here!",Chandler Bing,6,12,11,10
Monica!,Ross Geller,6,12,11,11
"Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.",Chandler Bing,6,12,11,12
Why do I have to decide?,Monica Geller,6,12,11,13
Because you're the only one that can be fair.,Chandler Bing,6,12,11,14
Yeah.,Ross Geller,6,12,11,15
I can't be fair. You're my boyfriend.,Monica Geller,6,12,11,16
"Yeah, but I'm your brother. We're family. That's the most important thing in the world.",Ross Geller,6,12,11,17
"Don't try to sway her. I'm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let's go.",Chandler Bing,6,12,11,18
We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me.,Ross Geller,6,12,11,19
"Okay, Chandler, you go first.",Monica Geller,6,12,11,20
"Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.",Chandler Bing,6,12,11,21
"Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?",Monica Geller,6,12,11,22
Can I finish my story?!,Chandler Bing,6,12,11,23
Do you want me to pick you?!,Monica Geller,6,12,11,24
"See, I would never snap at you like that.",Ross Geller,6,12,11,25
Continue.,Monica Geller,6,12,11,27
"So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.",Chandler Bing,6,12,11,28
"Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!",Ross Geller,6,12,11,29
I'm not arguing with that.,Chandler Bing,6,12,11,30
"All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.",Monica Geller,6,12,11,31
"You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!",Monica Geller,6,12,11,33
It's your joke.,Ross Geller,6,12,11,35
Is not.,Chandler Bing,6,12,11,36
"Hi, Chandler. There you are.",Monica Geller,6,12,12,2
"Hi, oh hi.",Chandler Bing,6,12,12,3
"Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?",Monica Geller,6,12,12,4
"Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and--generosity of spirit.",Chandler Bing,6,12,12,6
"Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.",Rachel Green,6,12,12,7
Really? I've heard better.,Phoebe Buffay,6,12,12,8
"Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.",Monica Geller,6,12,12,9
I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?,Chandler Bing,6,12,12,10
"Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!",Monica Geller,6,12,12,11
You're a little high maintenance.,Chandler Bing,6,12,12,12
Ahhh! You are on my list.,Monica Geller,6,12,12,13
"I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like ... maintaining you.",Chandler Bing,6,12,12,14
I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.,Monica Geller,6,12,12,15
I'm off the list.,Chandler Bing,6,12,12,16
"Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.",Monica Geller,6,12,12,17
"Y'know, suddenly I find you very attractive.",Phoebe Buffay,6,12,12,18
"Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?",Chandler Bing,6,12,12,20
"Not good, no. I didn't get the part, and I lost my job here, so ...",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,12,21
Wow! That is a bad audition.,Phoebe Buffay,6,12,12,22
How-how did you lose your job here?,Rachel Green,6,12,12,23
"Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,12,24
"He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.",Rachel Green,6,12,12,25
"Yeah, what are ya gonna do?",Joey Tribbiani,6,12,12,26
"Joey, you can't let him get away with that. Ya know what, I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'm going to say something to him-No, I really shouldn't say anything-No, I should say something to him. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him...",Rachel Green,6,12,12,27
What?,Rachel Green,6,12,12,29
"That's right, he can have his job back. I'm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.",Rachel Green,6,12,12,31
That's great. Thanks Rach.,Joey Tribbiani,6,12,12,32
"Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?",Rachel Green,6,12,12,33
"Rach, you're in my seat.",Phoebe Buffay,6,12,12,34
"Oh, I'm sorry.",Rachel Green,6,12,12,35
"Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.",Phoebe Buffay,6,12,13,2
"I pick you, Phoebe.",Monica Geller,6,12,13,3
"Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.",Rachel Green,6,12,13,4
"Yeah, well, I kinda thought.",Phoebe Buffay,6,12,13,5
Hey.,Chandler Bing,6,12,13,8
"Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?",Rachel Green,6,12,13,9
No way.,Ross Geller,6,12,13,10
I'm not answering that.,Joey Tribbiani,6,12,13,11
Joey! No way. I'm not answering that.,Chandler Bing,6,12,13,12
"Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that's $12.75.",Joey Tribbiani,6,13,1,2

I'm so sorry you're sick.,Chandler Bing,6,13,2,10
I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!,Monica Geller,6,13,2,11
"Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.",Rachel Green,6,13,2,12
I have not been sick in over three years!,Monica Geller,6,13,2,13
I'm gonna grab you some tissue.,Chandler Bing,6,13,2,14
I don't need a tissue! I'm fine-d!,Monica Geller,6,13,2,15
When you put a 'D' at the end of 'Fine' you're not fine.,Ross Geller,6,13,2,16
"I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d! Y'know, it's a really hard word to say.",Monica Geller,6,13,2,17

And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I'm the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you're gonna do.

"Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.",Ross Geller,6,13,3,14
I don't think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.,Ross Geller,6,13,3,16
"Seriously, I don't Rachel's gonna think it's a good idea.",Phoebe Buffay,6,13,3,18
I would love that job!,Phoebe Buffay,6,13,3,20

"Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!",Rachel Green,6,13,3,44
"All right, it's okay. One little setback is okay, just don't let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I'm just gonna take the-the pajmena. And the uh, and the uh pants. Y'know what, I'm just gonna take it all away, 'cause that way you'll just really learn the lesson. Okay?

Well why didn't you take the job?,Rachel Green,6,15,1,30

You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?,Phoebe Buffay,6,17,2,22

"All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi.",Ross Geller,6,17,2,26
"Ooh! Y'know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.",Rachel Green,6,17,2,27

"Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?",Phoebe Buffay,6,22,3,11

"No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?",Phoebe Buffay,6,22,3,13
I didn't know you could get married here.,Rachel Green,6,22,3,16
"This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.",Monica Geller,6,22,3,17
Oh sorry didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?,Rachel Green,6,22,3,19
"Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list",Rachel Green,6,22,3,21
What?! Are you crazy?! I'm not getting married! I'm not even engaged.,Monica Geller,6,22,3,22
"Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, y'know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.",Phoebe Buffay,6,22,3,23
"Yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it.",Rachel Green,6,22,3,24
"Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.",Monica Geller,6,22,3,25

Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?,Rachel Green,6,22,7,37
"Well, why do y'know go in that room and do your homework?",Rachel Green,6,22,7,39
"That's your, that's your dad's bedroom. That's your dad's bedroom!",Rachel Green,6,22,7,41

And I too am just a love machine.,Ross Geller,6,22,13,19
"I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.",Monica Geller,6,22,14,2
"I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.",Chandler Bing,6,22,14,3
"Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?",Monica Geller,6,22,14,4
Right here!,Chandler Bing,6,22,14,5
"Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel...",Monica Geller,6,22,14,6
"Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!",Chandler Bing,6,22,14,7
"It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.",Monica Geller,6,22,14,8
Okay.,Chandler Bing,6,22,14,9
Really?,Monica Geller,6,22,14,10
"Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready...",Chandler Bing,6,22,14,11
I know! I know.,Monica Geller,6,22,14,12
Okay.,Chandler Bing,6,22,14,13
I'm gonna go tell Joey that that you're back. I was really worried about you.,Monica Geller,6,22,14,14
"Hey, did she buy it?",Phoebe Buffay,6,22,14,15
Totally.,Chandler Bing,6,22,14,16
So did Heldi show you the place?,Phoebe Buffay,6,22,14,17

"Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!",Chandler Bing,6,23,1,2
"Now, have you told anyone else?",Phoebe Buffay,6,23,1,3
"No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.",Chandler Bing,6,23,1,4
You told me.,Phoebe Buffay,6,23,1,5
"Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.",Chandler Bing,6,23,1,6
"Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.",Phoebe Buffay,6,23,1,7
Me too.,Chandler Bing,6,23,1,8
Hey.,Joey Tribbiani,6,23,1,10

How rude.,Ross Geller,6,23,1,18
"Oh, I'm sorry. You wanna bite?",Joey Tribbiani,6,23,1,19
So how are things going with Paul?,Phoebe Buffay,6,23,2,2
"Good. Although y'know, he-he's a private guy. Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.",Rachel Green,6,23,2,3
That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.,Phoebe Buffay,6,23,2,4
So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?,Rachel Green,6,23,2,5
No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.,Phoebe Buffay,6,23,2,6
Hi!,Rachel Green,6,23,2,8

"Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?",Ross Geller,6,23,2,29
"Yeah! That was so weird, huh?",Phoebe Buffay,6,23,2,30
"Phoebe, why'd you do it?",Ross Geller,6,23,2,31
I didn't do it! It was Chandler! He's... He's mad at you!,Phoebe Buffay,6,23,2,32
What?! Why?!,Ross Geller,6,23,2,33
"Please, I think you know why.",Phoebe Buffay,6,23,2,34
I can't think of anything.,Ross Geller,6,23,2,35
"Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.",Phoebe Buffay,6,23,2,36
"Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?",Ross Geller,6,23,2,37
Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?,Phoebe Buffay,6,23,2,38
I guess it could.,Ross Geller,6,23,2,39
Well then I think that's it.,Phoebe Buffay,6,23,2,40
"Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.",Ross Geller,6,23,2,41
"Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.",Phoebe Buffay,6,23,2,42
"Yeah that's great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.",Rachel Green,6,23,3,3
"Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?",Rachel Green,6,23,3,5
"Yeah that's great Paul, but y'know I wanna know what--Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y'know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.",Rachel Green,6,23,3,7
"No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!",Rachel Green,6,23,3,9
"Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that's always a painful time! Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.",Rachel Green,6,23,3,11
"Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm... The rest of you life, y'know? Any regrets?",Rachel Green,6,23,3,13
"All right Paul, I'm not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!",Rachel Green,6,23,3,15

What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!,Rachel Green,6,23,3,30
"My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!",Rachel Green,6,23,3,32
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.,Chandler Bing,6,23,4,2
"Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.",Phoebe Buffay,6,23,4,3
"Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.",Chandler Bing,6,23,4,4
Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?,Phoebe Buffay,6,23,4,5
"Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one's nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?",Chandler Bing,6,23,4,6
"Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.",Phoebe Buffay,6,23,4,7
"Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.",Chandler Bing,6,23,4,9
"Or not, whatever.",Phoebe Buffay,6,23,4,10
"Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you...hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?",Chandler Bing,6,23,4,12
"Oh my God that's it, that's the ring! How much is it?",Chandler Bing,6,23,4,14
"Chandler, I-I will handle this! How much is it?",Phoebe Buffay,6,23,4,15
We will give you $10.,Phoebe Buffay,6,23,4,17
"Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.",Chandler Bing,6,23,4,19
We stand firm at $10.,Phoebe Buffay,6,23,4,21
"Uh, credit card. Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring.",Chandler Bing,6,23,4,23
"Okay. Listen, I'm sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.",Phoebe Buffay,6,23,4,24
I'll give you $1 for them.,Phoebe Buffay,6,23,4,26
"Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?",Ross Geller,6,23,5,2
No.,Joey Tribbiani,6,23,5,3
Remember? You-you were eating pizza.,Ross Geller,6,23,5,4
Yeah.,Joey Tribbiani,6,23,5,5
"Okay. Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.",Ross Geller,6,23,5,6
"Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!",Joey Tribbiani,6,23,5,7
"Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.",Ross Geller,6,23,5,8
Oh wow that's a great idea! And I still have his credit card.,Joey Tribbiani,6,23,5,9

"Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.",Monica Geller,6,23,6,5
What's the other one?,Rachel Green,6,23,6,6
"I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.",Monica Geller,6,23,6,7
"Oh that's right. You're the talker. Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.",Rachel Green,6,23,6,8
"Oh, we have some...",Monica Geller,6,23,6,9

"I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.",Phoebe Buffay,6,23,9,10
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.,Chandler Bing,6,23,9,11
Maybe it was the guy.,Phoebe Buffay,6,23,9,12

"I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out?

It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!,Phoebe Buffay,6,23,13,4
"No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.",Chandler Bing,6,23,13,5
Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.,Phoebe Buffay,6,23,13,6
I can't do that.,Chandler Bing,6,23,13,7
Well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.,Phoebe Buffay,6,23,13,8

"Yeah, she's dying... Of a cough apparently.",Chandler Bing,6,23,14,21
"Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity...",Phoebe Buffay,6,23,14,22

"Oh my God, you're back!",Joey Tribbiani,6,24,12,2
"Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!",Phoebe Buffay,6,24,12,3
Why do you want to see my hand?,Monica Geller,6,24,12,4
I wanna see what's in your hand. I wanna see the trash.,Phoebe Buffay,6,24,12,5
Yeah.,Joey Tribbiani,6,24,12,6
"Eww! Oh, it's all dirty. You should throw this out.",Phoebe Buffay,6,24,12,8
Okay.,Monica Geller,6,24,12,9

"I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!",Chandler Bing,6,24,12,14
We didn't ruin it!,Joey Tribbiani,6,24,12,15
Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!,Chandler Bing,6,24,12,16
"Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor...",Phoebe Buffay,6,24,12,17
Glove salesman!,Joey Tribbiani,6,24,12,18
Good one! Yeah.,Phoebe Buffay,6,24,12,19
This is terrible. What am I going to do?,Chandler Bing,6,24,12,20
"Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.",Phoebe Buffay,6,24,12,21
"That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.",Chandler Bing,6,24,12,22
Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!,Phoebe Buffay,6,24,12,23
"I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.",Chandler Bing,6,24,12,24
"Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!",Joey Tribbiani,6,24,12,25
I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!,Monica Geller,6,24,12,26
That guy's still doing that?!,Joey Tribbiani,6,24,12,27
"Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!",Rachel Green,6,24,12,28
"No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!",Phoebe Buffay,6,24,12,29
Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn't seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?,Ross Geller,6,24,13,2
"Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about...",Ross Geller,6,24,13,4
What?!,Ross Geller,6,24,13,6
"Okay, break-up's still on!",Ross Geller,6,24,13,8
"Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?",Chandler Bing,6,24,14,2
"Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before.",Joey Tribbiani,6,24,14,3

Hey!,Joey Tribbiani,6,24,14,5
Hey!,Chandler Bing,6,24,14,6
What are you up too?,Monica Geller,6,24,14,7
"Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.",Chandler Bing,6,24,14,8
"Yeah, Big Brother.",Joey Tribbiani,6,24,14,9
Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.,Monica Geller,6,24,14,10
"Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?",Chandler Bing,6,24,14,11
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!,Monica Geller,6,24,14,12
Eh...,Chandler Bing,6,24,14,13
Okay well that's good to know.,Monica Geller,6,24,14,14

"Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?",Monica Geller,6,24,15,9
"Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?",Monica Geller,6,24,15,11
What uh-What did you-What?!,Monica Geller,6,25,1,2
Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!,Monica Geller,6,25,1,4
Oh God... Why don't they put chairs back here?!,Monica Geller,6,25,1,6
What the... Yes you're too late! Where was all this three years ago?!,Monica Geller,6,25,1,8
What were you doing in Africa?,Monica Geller,6,25,1,10
"Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.",Monica Geller,6,25,1,12
"Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!",Monica Geller,6,25,1,14
Yeah!,Monica Geller,6,25,1,16

Me too! So happy for them!,Phoebe Buffay,6,25,2,7
I'm so happy and not at all jealous.,Rachel Green,6,25,2,8
"Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!",Phoebe Buffay,6,25,2,9
"I mean I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what's 2%? That's nothing.",Rachel Green,6,25,2,11
Totally. I'm like 90/10.,Phoebe Buffay,6,25,2,12
Yeah me too.,Rachel Green,6,25,2,13
"Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?",Joey Tribbiani,6,25,2,15
"Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.",Rachel Green,6,25,2,16
"So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?",Monica Geller,6,25,3,2
"Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!",Chandler Bing,6,25,3,3
"Yeah, but that's pigs not people!",Monica Geller,6,25,3,4
"If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.",Chandler Bing,6,25,3,5
Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?,Monica Geller,6,25,3,6
"Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.",Chandler Bing,6,25,3,7
Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!,Monica Geller,6,25,3,8
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!,Chandler Bing,6,25,3,9
Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!,Monica Geller,6,25,3,10
"It's okay, I got a plan.",Chandler Bing,6,25,3,12
We're gonna find love!,Rachel Green,6,25,4,2
Definitely!,Phoebe Buffay,6,25,4,3
"Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.",Rachel Green,6,25,4,4
What do you mean?,Phoebe Buffay,6,25,4,5
"Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.",Rachel Green,6,25,4,6
You mean a backup?,Phoebe Buffay,6,25,4,7
Exactly!,Rachel Green,6,25,4,8
"Yeah, yeah I got that.",Phoebe Buffay,6,25,4,9
You do?,Rachel Green,6,25,4,10
Hm-mmm.,Phoebe Buffay,6,25,4,11

Are you serious?!,Rachel Green,6,25,4,16
"Yeah, I locked him years ago!",Phoebe Buffay,6,25,4,17
"Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.",Rachel Green,6,25,4,18
"Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.",Phoebe Buffay,6,25,4,19
"Oh, seriously?",Rachel Green,6,25,4,20
"Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were...",Phoebe Buffay,6,25,4,21
Charming.,Rachel Green,6,25,4,22
"Well hey, it's just a backup.",Phoebe Buffay,6,25,4,23
Yeah.,Rachel Green,6,25,4,24
Hey Monica!,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,5,2
Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?,Monica Geller,6,25,5,3
"This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?",Joey Tribbiani,6,25,5,4
"Yeah, it's great.",Monica Geller,6,25,5,5
"Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!",Joey Tribbiani,6,25,5,6
I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!,Monica Geller,6,25,5,7
Chandler giving you a hard time huh?,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,5,8
"It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!",Monica Geller,6,25,5,9
"Well, you know Chandler.",Joey Tribbiani,6,25,5,10
No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.,Monica Geller,6,25,5,11
Maybe you changed?,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,5,12
I didn't change!,Monica Geller,6,25,5,13
Maybe that's the problem.,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,5,14
What?!,Monica Geller,6,25,5,15
"Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.",Joey Tribbiani,6,25,5,16
Is that some kind of boat talk?,Monica Geller,6,25,5,17
I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,5,18
What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?,Monica Geller,6,25,5,19
"Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!",Joey Tribbiani,6,25,5,20
Well there's some people who do want to marry me.,Monica Geller,6,25,5,21
There are?,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,5,22
Yeah! Richard!,Monica Geller,6,25,5,23
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,5,24
That's right.,Monica Geller,6,25,5,25
Chandler loves marriage!!,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,5,26
You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!,Monica Geller,6,25,5,27
You got that from what I said?!,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,5,28
What happened you guys?,Ross Geller,6,25,6,3
Rach!,Ross Geller,6,25,6,5
Hey you!,Rachel Green,6,25,6,6
"Hey, come on in.",Ross Geller,6,25,6,7
"Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.",Rachel Green,6,25,6,8
"Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.",Ross Geller,6,25,6,9
"Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?",Rachel Green,6,25,6,10
I guess so.,Ross Geller,6,25,6,11
"So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, ""What's that?!""",Rachel Green,6,25,6,12
Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.,Ross Geller,6,25,6,13
Exactly.,Rachel Green,6,25,6,14
"Ohh, yeah I already have one.",Ross Geller,6,25,6,15
What? Who?,Rachel Green,6,25,6,16
Phoebe.,Ross Geller,6,25,6,17
"Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.",Rachel Green,6,25,6,18
"Ohh, I don't think so.",Ross Geller,6,25,6,19
"Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!",Rachel Green,6,25,6,20
"That's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.",Ross Geller,6,25,6,21
Where the hell have you been?!,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,7,2
I was making a coconut phone with the professor.,Chandler Bing,6,25,7,3
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,7,4
What?!,Chandler Bing,6,25,7,5
"Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!",Joey Tribbiani,6,25,7,6
My-Oh my God!,Chandler Bing,6,25,7,7
I know! They suck!!,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,7,8
He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!,Chandler Bing,6,25,7,9
I know!,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,7,10
Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!,Chandler Bing,6,25,7,11
"Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!",Joey Tribbiani,6,25,7,12
You're right.,Chandler Bing,6,25,7,13
Yeah!,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,7,14
Okay. I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna go find her and I'm just going to propose!,Chandler Bing,6,25,7,15
Okay.,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,7,16
Okay great.,Chandler Bing,6,25,7,17
Dude-dude-dude!,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,7,18
What?!,Chandler Bing,6,25,7,19
"Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.",Joey Tribbiani,6,25,7,20
Hi.,Monica Geller,6,25,8,2
I don't know why I'm here.,Monica Geller,6,25,8,4
I don't know.,Monica Geller,6,25,8,6
Chandler is such an idiot!,Monica Geller,6,25,8,8
"Yeah, I'll have a scotch...",Monica Geller,6,25,8,10
Still smoking cigars?,Monica Geller,6,25,8,12
"No that's, that's okay.",Monica Geller,6,25,8,14
"Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.",Monica Geller,6,25,8,16
Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.,Monica Geller,6,25,8,18
Edward Nevski?,Monica Geller,6,25,8,20
No.,Monica Geller,6,25,8,22
But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.,Monica Geller,6,25,8,24
Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!,Rachel Green,6,25,9,2
"Of course I can! It's just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I've already lost Chandler!",Phoebe Buffay,6,25,9,3
What?!,Rachel Green,6,25,9,4
Hey!,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,9,5
Hey!,Ross Geller,6,25,9,6
Phoebe! We're both your backup?!,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,9,7
"Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!",Ross Geller,6,25,9,8
I don't-Look I don't know what you're complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!,Phoebe Buffay,6,25,9,9
No we weren't!,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,9,11
I was not!,Ross Geller,6,25,9,12
"Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married!",Phoebe Buffay,6,25,9,13
Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!,Rachel Green,6,25,9,14
Pick me!!,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,9,15
No! Pick me! I don't want to end up an old maid!,Ross Geller,6,25,9,16
"All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!",Phoebe Buffay,6,25,9,17
"This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!",Joey Tribbiani,6,25,9,18
"Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!",Ross Geller,6,25,9,19
"No wait! Just-Okay-Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don't make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.",Phoebe Buffay,6,25,9,21
"Oh God, Phoebe!",Rachel Green,6,25,9,22
I'm talking about massages.,Phoebe Buffay,6,25,9,23
Oh.,Rachel Green,6,25,9,24
"Okay, y'know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we're gonna do! I'm gonna write Joey on one napkin and I'm gonna right Ross on the other napkin and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?",Rachel Green,6,25,9,26
Okay that's fair.,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,9,27

"I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!",Monica Geller,6,25,10,2
Oh! Him.,Monica Geller,6,25,10,4
"I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!",Monica Geller,6,25,10,6
"Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!",Monica Geller,6,25,10,8
"Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!",Monica Geller,6,25,10,10
Nothing. I don't kn-Umm. I don't know. Umm...,Monica Geller,6,25,10,12

"Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.",Chandler Bing,6,25,11,9
Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?,Chandler Bing,6,25,11,11
Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!,Chandler Bing,6,25,11,13
And what does she have to think about? I love her!,Chandler Bing,6,25,11,15
"But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!",Chandler Bing,6,25,11,17
"It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.",Chandler Bing,6,25,11,19
Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?,Chandler Bing,6,25,11,21
Y'know Richard...you are a good guy.,Chandler Bing,6,25,11,23

She's gone. She had a bag and she left.,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,12,6
What are you talking about?,Chandler Bing,6,25,12,7
"She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.",Joey Tribbiani,6,25,12,8
Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!,Chandler Bing,6,25,12,9
"I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.",Joey Tribbiani,6,25,12,10
Well where... Where did she go?,Chandler Bing,6,25,12,11
To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,12,12
I can't believe I ruined this.,Chandler Bing,6,25,12,13
I am so sorry man.,Joey Tribbiani,6,25,12,14
You wanted it to be a surprise.,Monica Geller,6,25,12,16
Oh my God.,Chandler Bing,6,25,12,18
Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!,Monica Geller,6,25,12,20
"Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?",Chandler Bing,6,25,12,21

"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?",Phoebe Buffay,7,2,2,13
"All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.",Monica Geller,7,2,3,2
Okay.,Rachel Green,7,2,3,3
"All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.",Monica Geller,7,2,3,4
Aw.,Rachel Green,7,2,3,5
"A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.",Monica Geller,7,2,3,6
"Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.",Chandler Bing,7,2,3,7
"Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?",Joey Tribbiani,7,2,3,8
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?,Chandler Bing,7,2,3,9
"Well, the duck...",Joey Tribbiani,7,2,3,10
What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!,Rachel Green,7,2,3,11
"Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!",Joey Tribbiani,7,2,3,12
"Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?",Chandler Bing,7,2,3,13
"Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!",Monica Geller,7,2,3,14
Okay.,Chandler Bing,7,2,3,15
Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?,Monica Geller,7,2,3,16
Centerpieces!,Chandler Bing,7,2,3,17
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?,Monica Geller,7,2,3,18
"Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.",Chandler Bing,7,2,3,19
Oh my God! It's like one mind.,Monica Geller,7,2,3,20
Uh-huh!,Chandler Bing,7,2,3,21
"Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!",Joey Tribbiani,7,2,3,22
"Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!",Rachel Green,7,2,3,23
"Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!",Joey Tribbiani,7,2,3,24
What?!,Rachel Green,7,2,3,25
"All right, I'm gonna go!",Joey Tribbiani,7,2,3,26
"Now Joey, what did the duck do?!",Rachel Green,7,2,3,27
I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!,Joey Tribbiani,7,2,3,28
"Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That's so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar... The vicar? ...wouldn't be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his... Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!",Joey Tribbiani,7,2,3,30
"Uh, Phoebe...",Ross Geller,7,2,4,2
"Oh Ross, hi.",Phoebe Buffay,7,2,4,3
"Phoebe, what are you doing?",Ross Geller,7,2,4,4
"I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.",Phoebe Buffay,7,2,4,5
Phoebe!,Ross Geller,7,2,4,6
"Okay, let's talk outside.",Phoebe Buffay,7,2,4,7
"Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment!",Ross Geller,7,2,4,9
What's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's!,Phoebe Buffay,7,2,4,10
And they knew about it?,Ross Geller,7,2,4,11
"Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?",Phoebe Buffay,7,2,4,12
"Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!",Ross Geller,7,2,4,13
"Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!",Phoebe Buffay,7,2,4,14
"The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.",Ross Geller,7,2,4,15
"Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?",Rachel Green,7,2,5,2
Sweepin'. Why? Turn you on?,Joey Tribbiani,7,2,5,3
No.,Rachel Green,7,2,5,4
Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?,Joey Tribbiani,7,2,5,5
"Joey, did you my face cream?",Rachel Green,7,2,5,6
Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.,Joey Tribbiani,7,2,5,8
"Joey, where did you learn that word?",Rachel Green,7,2,5,10
"Where do you think, Zelda?",Joey Tribbiani,7,2,5,11
You found my book?!,Rachel Green,7,2,5,12
Yeah I did!,Joey Tribbiani,7,2,5,13
"Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!",Rachel Green,7,2,5,14
"Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!",Joey Tribbiani,7,2,5,15
"Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.",Rachel Green,7,2,5,16
You got porn!,Joey Tribbiani,7,2,5,17
Hello.,Ross Geller,7,2,6,2
"Uh no-no, she-she's out for the night.",Ross Geller,7,2,6,4
"Can I, can I help you with something?",Ross Geller,7,2,6,6
Yes I am.,Ross Geller,7,2,6,8
"Oh yeah, I should probably call them.",Chandler Bing,7,2,7,3
"Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.",Chandler Bing,7,2,7,5
"Oh dad, really you don't need to...",Monica Geller,7,2,7,6
What a sweet story.,Chandler Bing,7,2,7,9
"Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.",Monica Geller,7,2,7,10
"Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?",Monica Geller,7,2,7,12
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?,Monica Geller,7,2,7,14
I don't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!,Monica Geller,7,2,8,2
You bought the beach house when I was 23!,Monica Geller,7,2,8,4
What about when I started dating Chandler?,Monica Geller,7,2,8,8
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.,Chandler Bing,7,2,8,10
I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!,Monica Geller,7,2,8,11
"Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you. Ohh, that's soft.",Ross Geller,7,2,9,2
I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?,Monica Geller,7,2,10,2
"I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.",Chandler Bing,7,2,10,3
Well what happened at dinner?,Rachel Green,7,2,10,4
My parents spent the money for our wedding!,Monica Geller,7,2,10,5
My God! What did you order?!,Phoebe Buffay,7,2,10,6
"Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!",Rachel Green,7,2,10,7
"Honey, it's gonna be okay.",Chandler Bing,7,2,10,8
No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!,Monica Geller,7,2,10,9
"No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.",Rachel Green,7,2,10,10
"Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.",Chandler Bing,7,2,10,11
Do you even understand what off the rack means?!,Rachel Green,7,2,10,12
"Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?",Phoebe Buffay,7,2,10,13
How? I don't have any money.,Monica Geller,7,2,10,14
"Well, I have some.",Chandler Bing,7,2,10,15
How much?,Monica Geller,7,2,10,16
"Well, close to...",Chandler Bing,7,2,10,17

Well what?! How-how much is it?!,Rachel Green,7,2,10,19
It's enough for wedding scenario eight.,Monica Geller,7,2,10,20
Ohh! Really?!,Rachel Green,7,2,10,21
"How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!",Monica Geller,7,2,10,22
"Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.",Rachel Green,7,2,10,23
"Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?",Chandler Bing,7,2,10,24
"Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.",Chandler Bing,7,2,10,26
"Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.",Phoebe Buffay,7,2,10,27
This is the most special day of our lives.,Monica Geller,7,2,10,28
"No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.",Chandler Bing,7,2,10,29
"Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.",Monica Geller,7,2,10,30
"Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.",Chandler Bing,7,2,10,31
You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?,Monica Geller,7,2,10,32
"Yes, I am!",Chandler Bing,7,2,10,33
"Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.",Phoebe Buffay,7,2,10,34
Hey Rach.,Joey Tribbiani,7,2,11,2

"Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.",Rachel Green,7,2,11,5
"No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.",Joey Tribbiani,7,2,11,6
"Well no, I don't smell anything.",Rachel Green,7,2,11,7
"Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.",Joey Tribbiani,7,2,11,8
"Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?",Ross Geller,7,2,11,9
Nothing!,Rachel Green,7,2,11,10
"Damn, this coffee's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?",Ross Geller,7,2,11,11
"Y'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!",Rachel Green,7,2,11,12
So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?,Ross Geller,7,2,11,13
"Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.",Rachel Green,7,2,11,14
"Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! 'Sup?",Ross Geller,7,2,11,15
Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!,Phoebe Buffay,7,2,11,16
Excuse me ladies. I'm sorry?,Ross Geller,7,2,11,17
"My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.",Phoebe Buffay,7,2,11,18
I gave him an extremely professional massage!,Ross Geller,7,2,11,19
He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.,Phoebe Buffay,7,2,11,20
"Okay, so it wasn't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.",Ross Geller,7,2,11,21
"Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!",Phoebe Buffay,7,2,11,22
"Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.",Ross Geller,7,2,11,23
"Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!",Phoebe Buffay,7,2,11,24
"He said he liked that!! Oh you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.",Ross Geller,7,2,11,25
"Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?",Joey Tribbiani,7,2,11,26
His daughter was hot.,Ross Geller,7,2,11,27
Gotcha.,Joey Tribbiani,7,2,11,28
Hey.,Monica Geller,7,2,12,2

Ehh.,Chandler Bing,7,2,12,5
"Eh, you work for that.",Monica Geller,7,2,12,6
"Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.",Chandler Bing,7,2,12,7
You do?!,Monica Geller,7,2,12,8
"Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.",Chandler Bing,7,2,12,9
"Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?",Monica Geller,7,2,12,10

You thought about that?,Monica Geller,7,2,12,12

How many kids were we gonna have?,Monica Geller,7,2,12,14
"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.",Chandler Bing,7,2,12,15
What else did you think about?,Monica Geller,7,2,12,16
"Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.",Chandler Bing,7,2,12,17
"Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.",Monica Geller,7,2,12,18
Sure you do.,Chandler Bing,7,2,12,19

"If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.",Monica Geller,7,3,2,4
"Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.",Rachel Green,7,3,2,5
"Oh, I already have one.",Monica Geller,7,3,2,6
Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.,Phoebe Buffay,7,3,2,7
"Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.",Rachel Green,7,3,2,8
"Hey, I know I what I want!",Monica Geller,7,3,2,9

Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!,Joey Tribbiani,7,3,2,24

"Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.",Joey Tribbiani,7,3,2,26
"Well, it's good that you finally have a place to do that.",Chandler Bing,7,3,2,27
"Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.",Rachel Green,7,3,2,28
You could?,Joey Tribbiani,7,3,2,29

"No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.",Ross Geller,7,3,3,13
"This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.",Monica Geller,7,3,3,14
Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.,Ross Geller,7,3,3,15
"Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.",Monica Geller,7,3,3,16

"Time's up, now your dead.",Rachel Green,7,3,4,16

You're Lewis Posin.,Monica Geller,7,6,7,4
Who?,Chandler Bing,7,6,7,5
"Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?",Monica Geller,7,6,7,6
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!,Chandler Bing,7,6,7,7

"No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!",Joey Tribbiani,7,6,8,10
"Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.",Rachel Green,7,6,8,11
"Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!",Joey Tribbiani,7,6,8,12

"Ohh, wait a minute, we haven't pre...",Rachel Green,7,6,8,27
Go!,Ross Geller,7,6,8,28
"Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.",Rachel Green,7,6,8,29
"Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.",Rachel Green,7,6,8,31
Wow. Good speech.,Joey Tribbiani,7,6,8,32

"Okay Phoebe, I guess you're next although I really don't see the point.",Ross Geller,7,6,8,35
Yeah.,Joey Tribbiani,7,6,8,36

And she's back in the game.,Joey Tribbiani,7,6,8,39
"Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.",Chandler Bing,7,6,9,2
"It's a nickname, I'll explain later.",Chandler Bing,7,6,9,4
It's pretty clear.,Monica Geller,7,6,9,5
"Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.",Chandler Bing,7,6,9,6
"You-you-you didn't know that. Well, I guess my work here is done!",Chandler Bing,7,6,9,8
"All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!",Joey Tribbiani,7,6,10,2
Really?! I won!,Phoebe Buffay,7,6,10,3
What?!,Rachel Green,7,6,10,4
"I'm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.",Ross Geller,7,6,10,5
Well then I demand a recount!,Rachel Green,7,6,10,6
"Actually, it wasn't that close.",Ross Geller,7,6,10,7
"No! Y'know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous-We're gonna flip a coin! All right?! Heads!",Rachel Green,7,6,10,8
The coins have finally forgiven me!,Phoebe Buffay,7,6,10,9
"Well y'know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower!",Rachel Green,7,6,10,10
"Rach, it's gonna be okay! You guys are the best!",Phoebe Buffay,7,6,10,11
"Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.",Joey Tribbiani,7,6,10,12
Yeah?,Ross Geller,7,6,10,13
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.,Joey Tribbiani,7,6,10,14
Why-why would I care about that?,Ross Geller,7,6,10,15
"No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be.",Joey Tribbiani,7,6,10,16
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I'm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.,Chandler Bing,7,6,11,2
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn't have to apologize.,Monica Geller,7,6,11,3
I would really love it if could do both.,Chandler Bing,7,6,11,4
"All right, I...I have to ask.",Monica Geller,7,6,11,5
What?,Chandler Bing,7,6,11,6
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?,Monica Geller,7,6,11,7
What?!,Chandler Bing,7,6,11,8
"Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?",Monica Geller,7,6,11,9
A hundred and forty-five pounds.,Chandler Bing,7,6,11,10
In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.,Monica Geller,7,6,11,11
"Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!",Chandler Bing,7,6,11,12
"Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.",Monica Geller,7,6,11,13
"Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.",Chandler Bing,7,6,11,14
How?,Monica Geller,7,6,11,15
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!,Chandler Bing,7,6,11,16
"What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!",Monica Geller,7,6,11,17
"Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.",Chandler Bing,7,6,11,18
Keep going.,Monica Geller,7,6,11,19
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.,Chandler Bing,7,6,11,20
Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?,Monica Geller,7,6,11,21
I'd carry you around in my pocket.,Chandler Bing,7,6,11,22
I love you.,Monica Geller,7,6,11,23

"Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y'know just in case...",Rachel Green,7,6,12,8
Oh that's so sweet thanks.,Phoebe Buffay,7,6,12,9
"Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here's a little purse that I found. Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.",Rachel Green,7,6,12,10
Ohh.,Phoebe Buffay,7,6,12,11
"And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y'know 'cause, people cry at weddings. I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.",Rachel Green,7,6,12,12
This stuff is great!,Phoebe Buffay,7,6,12,13
"Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica's something borrowed and it's blue. Yeah...",Rachel Green,7,6,12,14
"Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor.",Phoebe Buffay,7,6,12,15
You do? Why?,Rachel Green,7,6,12,16
Because I think it means more to you.,Phoebe Buffay,7,6,12,17
"But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.",Rachel Green,7,6,12,18
"Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?",Phoebe Buffay,7,6,12,19
"No, I was ten. I just developed early.",Rachel Green,7,6,12,20
Man alive!,Phoebe Buffay,7,6,12,21

"Ohh, wow! That's great! Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we'll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I'm so excited!",Monica Geller,7,6,12,25
"Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she's gonna be yours.",Rachel Green,7,6,12,26

"Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.",Joey Tribbiani,7,7,1,8
Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!,Rachel Green,7,7,1,9

"Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?",Rachel Green,7,7,1,11

"Ah... Ah...Get out of here! Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?",Ross Geller,7,7,10,6

Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?,Phoebe Buffay,7,7,11,7

Because Chandler still has feelings for you!,Monica Geller,7,7,12,29

"I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.",Monica Geller,7,7,12,34

What? That's like insanely easy!,Ross Geller,7,8,1,7
"Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .",Chandler Bing,7,8,1,8
"It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.",Monica Geller,7,8,1,9
What? You forgot fourteen states?,Ross Geller,7,8,1,10
Nobody cares about the Dakotas.,Monica Geller,7,8,1,11

Done! With time a-to-spare.,Ross Geller,7,8,2,12
Oooh that may be a New World's record,Chandler Bing,7,8,2,13
"You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called ""a globe?"" Hmm?",Ross Geller,7,8,2,14
"Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.",Chandler Bing,7,8,2,15

"No, just give me another minute.",Ross Geller,7,8,2,20
"Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.",Chandler Bing,7,8,2,21
"This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.",Ross Geller,7,8,2,22
"Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!",Chandler Bing,7,8,2,23
You're on!,Ross Geller,7,8,2,24
"All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.",Joey Tribbiani,7,8,2,25
"Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?",Monica Geller,7,8,2,26

It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.,Phoebe Buffay,7,8,2,39
Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?,Monica Geller,7,8,3,2
I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.,Chandler Bing,7,8,3,3
That's my pie!,Monica Geller,7,8,3,4
Which smells delicious!,Chandler Bing,7,8,3,5
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!,Monica Geller,7,8,3,6

"We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!",Monica Geller,7,8,3,8
Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?,Phoebe Buffay,7,8,4,2
"Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?",Monica Geller,7,8,4,3

"Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!",Chandler Bing,7,8,4,6

What is it doing here?,Chandler Bing,7,8,4,28
"Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?",Phoebe Buffay,7,8,4,29
"Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!",Monica Geller,7,8,4,30
"Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!",Chandler Bing,7,8,4,31
"That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days",Phoebe Buffay,7,8,4,32
Really?,Chandler Bing,7,8,4,33
"Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?",Monica Geller,7,8,4,34
"Well, it still has to go, right?",Chandler Bing,7,8,4,35
"Okay, it's um...",Chandler Bing,7,8,4,37

"They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.",Chandler Bing,7,8,4,46
"Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!",Ross Geller,7,8,4,47
"Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?",Rachel Green,7,8,4,48
Is there a puppy here?,Chandler Bing,7,8,4,49
"Okay, you are new!",Chandler Bing,7,8,4,51
"Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin' ice cream.",Joey Tribbiani,7,8,4,52
You don't like ice cream?,Phoebe Buffay,7,8,4,53
It's too cold.,Ross Geller,7,8,4,54
"Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.",Chandler Bing,7,8,4,55
It hurts my teeth.,Ross Geller,7,8,4,56
"And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!",Chandler Bing,7,8,4,57
How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.,Ross Geller,7,8,4,59
1250.,Monica Geller,7,8,4,60
"Damn, I forgot you were here.",Ross Geller,7,8,4,61
All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute.,Phoebe Buffay,7,8,4,62
"Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?",Rachel Green,7,8,4,63
Yeah.,Monica Geller,7,8,4,64
"When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?",Rachel Green,7,8,4,65
"Oh, I'd say about a month.",Phoebe Buffay,7,8,4,66
Really? I'd say 3 to 4.,Monica Geller,7,8,4,67
Half hour.,Joey Tribbiani,7,8,4,68
Interesting.,Rachel Green,7,8,4,69
"When it's your assistant, I would say never.",Monica Geller,7,8,4,70
"All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.",Joey Tribbiani,7,8,4,71
Huh. A moo-point?,Rachel Green,7,8,4,72
"Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.",Joey Tribbiani,7,8,4,73
"Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?",Rachel Green,7,8,4,74
"Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.",Monica Geller,7,8,4,75
"You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.",Rachel Green,7,8,4,76
"Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.",Joey Tribbiani,7,8,4,77
Hey!,Rachel Green,7,8,4,79
How are you holding up?,Rachel Green,7,8,4,81
Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.,Rachel Green,7,8,4,83
So were you guys together a long time?,Rachel Green,7,8,4,85
Now that she broke up with you?,Rachel Green,7,8,4,87
Yeah. Hmmmm.,Rachel Green,7,8,4,89
"No...Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it...it has to work out.",Rachel Green,7,8,4,91
"Because, uh-it has to.",Rachel Green,7,8,4,93
"Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.",Rachel Green,7,8,4,95
"Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!",Rachel Green,7,8,4,97
"All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!",Joey Tribbiani,7,8,4,98
"Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay...",Joey Tribbiani,7,8,4,100
"Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!",Rachel Green,7,8,5,3
"No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.",Rachel Green,7,8,5,5
"Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.",Rachel Green,7,8,5,7
What?,Rachel Green,7,8,5,9
"Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?",Rachel Green,7,8,5,11
"Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay.",Rachel Green,7,8,5,13
"Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.",Monica Geller,7,8,6,2
"Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.",Phoebe Buffay,7,8,6,3
Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.,Monica Geller,7,8,6,4
"Yeah, okay.",Phoebe Buffay,7,8,6,5
"Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!",Monica Geller,7,8,6,7
"You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.",Phoebe Buffay,7,8,6,8
That's not gonna work.,Monica Geller,7,8,6,9
I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.,Phoebe Buffay,7,8,6,10
Hey! I didn't know either.,Monica Geller,7,8,6,11
"Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?",Phoebe Buffay,7,8,6,12
"Yeah, I knew.",Monica Geller,7,8,6,13
Where's Chandler?,Phoebe Buffay,7,8,7,2
Here I am.,Chandler Bing,7,8,7,3
Wash your hands!!!,Phoebe Buffay,7,8,7,4
How did you...know?,Chandler Bing,7,8,7,5
Hey! What's she doing back here?,Ross Geller,7,8,7,7
"Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!",Monica Geller,7,8,7,8
"Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...",Ross Geller,7,8,7,9
"No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.",Phoebe Buffay,7,8,7,10
"Yeah, but, but look what I'm...",Ross Geller,7,8,7,11
"See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.",Phoebe Buffay,7,8,7,12
Where's Monica?,Chandler Bing,7,8,7,13
"Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.",Ross Geller,7,8,7,14
Why not?,Chandler Bing,7,8,7,15
Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.,Ross Geller,7,8,7,17
"Well, I, I should go in there.",Chandler Bing,7,8,7,18
"No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.",Ross Geller,7,8,7,19
Why not?,Chandler Bing,7,8,7,20
Because you sent away the dog!,Ross Geller,7,8,7,21
This is ridiculous.,Chandler Bing,7,8,7,22
"Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend...Phyllis...take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.",Ross Geller,7,8,7,23
"Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?",Joey Tribbiani,7,8,7,24
"Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.",Chandler Bing,7,8,7,25
"So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.",Joey Tribbiani,7,8,7,26
"Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?",Chandler Bing,7,8,7,27
"Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.",Joey Tribbiani,7,8,7,28
And that doesn't scare you?,Chandler Bing,7,8,7,29
"Ross, you need some help?",Joey Tribbiani,7,8,7,30
"From you? Yes, please!",Ross Geller,7,8,7,31
"First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!",Joey Tribbiani,7,8,7,32
"I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.",Ross Geller,7,8,7,34
Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.,Joey Tribbiani,7,8,7,36
"Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out",Rachel Green,7,8,7,37
"If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.",Joey Tribbiani,7,8,7,38
"Hey, is Chandler here?",Phoebe Buffay,7,8,7,40
"No, no he went for a walk.",Chandler Bing,7,8,7,41
"Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!",Phoebe Buffay,7,8,7,42
Hi!,Rachel Green,7,8,7,44
Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!,Joey Tribbiani,7,8,7,45
"Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!",Phoebe Buffay,7,8,7,46
You think?,Joey Tribbiani,7,8,7,47
"Hi, honey.",Monica Geller,7,8,7,49
"Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.",Chandler Bing,7,8,7,50
"What? Why, why would...",Monica Geller,7,8,7,51
"Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.",Phoebe Buffay,7,8,7,52
"Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y'know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.",Chandler Bing,7,8,7,53
"We have good news, look whose back!",Phoebe Buffay,7,8,7,54
Hi!,Rachel Green,7,8,7,55
Clunkers?! Oh my god!,Chandler Bing,7,8,7,56
"That's right, she came back all by herself.",Monica Geller,7,8,7,57
It's a Thanksgiving miracle!,Phoebe Buffay,7,8,7,58
It is so good to see you!,Chandler Bing,7,8,7,59
"Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?",Phoebe Buffay,7,8,7,60
"Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.",Ross Geller,7,8,7,62
It's up to you.,Chandler Bing,7,8,7,63
"Oh, hi! How are you doing?",Rachel Green,7,8,7,65
Oh.,Rachel Green,7,8,7,67
"Tag? Y-You're going? Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?",Ross Geller,7,8,7,69
"Ah, what good are you.",Ross Geller,7,8,7,71
"Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.",Rachel Green,7,8,7,73
"Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It-y'know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?",Rachel Green,7,8,7,75
"Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.",Rachel Green,7,8,7,77
Really?,Rachel Green,7,8,7,79
"Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.",Rachel Green,7,8,7,81
Delaware! Delaware!,Ross Geller,7,8,8,2
All right.,Chandler Bing,7,8,8,3
I want my turkey now!,Ross Geller,7,8,8,4
You got it. You got Nevada twice.,Chandler Bing,7,8,8,5
I know.,Ross Geller,7,8,8,6

You sure?,Ross Geller,7,9,1,3
"Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.",Chandler Bing,7,9,1,5
"No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it's all yours.",Ross Geller,7,9,1,7
Okay. Okay.,Chandler Bing,7,9,1,8
Yes! Yes! Yes!!,Ross Geller,7,9,1,9
"His first big kid's bike, this is so exciting!",Phoebe Buffay,7,9,1,10
"Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent.",Monica Geller,7,9,1,11
Yeah.,Ross Geller,7,9,1,12
I never had a bike of my own.,Phoebe Buffay,7,9,1,13
What?!,Ross Geller,7,9,1,14
"Well, we didn't have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.",Phoebe Buffay,7,9,1,15
That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one.,Chandler Bing,7,9,1,16
Ohh.,Ross Geller,7,9,1,17
Did the girl ever let you ride it?,Monica Geller,7,9,1,18
No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.,Phoebe Buffay,7,9,1,19
That is so unfair!,Ross Geller,7,9,1,20
"Not really, I got to drag him around too!",Phoebe Buffay,7,9,1,21
Hey! What are you guys doing?,Chandler Bing,7,9,2,2
Hey.,Joey Tribbiani,7,9,2,3
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.,Monica Geller,7,9,2,4
"I'm sorry, who?",Chandler Bing,7,9,2,5
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.,Monica Geller,7,9,2,6
But we don't know the neighbors.,Chandler Bing,7,9,2,7
"I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.",Joey Tribbiani,7,9,2,8
See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.,Monica Geller,7,9,2,9
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?,Chandler Bing,7,9,2,10
Gooood morning!!,Rachel Green,7,9,2,11
"Eh, somebody's in a good mood!",Chandler Bing,7,9,2,12
"Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!",Rachel Green,7,9,2,13
Where you can make out with your assistant.,Monica Geller,7,9,2,14
"Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.",Rachel Green,7,9,2,15
"Oh yeah, what's the plan?",Monica Geller,7,9,2,16
We... We are not... ...going to let it... be a problem.,Rachel Green,7,9,2,17
Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!,Monica Geller,7,9,2,18

Okay.,Monica Geller,7,9,2,24
"Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?",Rachel Green,7,9,3,2
"Okay, thank you. That'll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.",Rachel Green,7,9,3,4
"Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.",Rachel Green,7,9,3,6
"Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y'know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.",Rachel Green,7,9,3,8
"No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?",Rachel Green,7,9,3,10
"The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!",Monica Geller,7,9,4,2
"Well, either that or uh...",Chandler Bing,7,9,4,3
Joey!!,Monica Geller,7,9,4,4
Yeah?,Joey Tribbiani,7,9,4,6
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!,Monica Geller,7,9,4,7
"Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!",Joey Tribbiani,7,9,4,8
"Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!",Phoebe Buffay,7,9,4,9
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!,Monica Geller,7,9,4,10

I'm thinkin' no.,Rachel Green,7,9,6,6
"Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.",Rachel Green,7,9,6,8
"Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, ""Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision,"" and under Problems with Performance I wrote, ""Dear God, I hope not,"" and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.",Rachel Green,7,9,6,10
"Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.",Monica Geller,7,9,7,2

What happened? I'm just eating candy.,Chandler Bing,7,9,8,3
"Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.",Rachel Green,7,9,8,4
"Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.",Chandler Bing,7,9,8,5

"Some people have been saying its y'know little drops of heaven, but whatever.",Monica Geller,7,9,8,20
"Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?",Joey Tribbiani,7,9,8,22
"Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?",Chandler Bing,7,9,8,23
"All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!",Monica Geller,7,9,8,24
It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!,Monica Geller,7,9,8,28
Y'know what would work?,Chandler Bing,7,9,8,29

"Phoebe, you can't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!",Ross Geller,7,9,9,4
Why? Why do I have to learn?,Phoebe Buffay,7,9,9,5

What?! Why?!,Phoebe Buffay,7,9,10,16
"Because! Because, it-it-it's... It'd be like you having this guitar and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit! The bike is dying.",Ross Geller,7,9,10,17

Okay Ross! Please don't die!,Phoebe Buffay,7,9,10,20
"Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.",Rachel Green,7,9,11,2
"Yeah, well Betty's kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.",Rachel Green,7,9,11,4
Let's roll!,Rachel Green,7,9,11,6
"Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything-minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan.",Rachel Green,7,9,11,9

"Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!",Monica Geller,7,9,12,10
"All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?",Chandler Bing,7,9,12,12
No not Candy Lady.,Chandler Bing,7,9,12,14

Thank you.,Monica Geller,7,9,12,18
You're welcome.,Chandler Bing,7,9,12,19
Did you smoke?,Monica Geller,7,9,12,20
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?,Chandler Bing,7,9,12,21
"I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.",Monica Geller,7,9,12,22
"Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...",Joey Tribbiani,7,9,12,23
I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.,Phoebe Buffay,7,9,13,2

"Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special.",Phoebe Buffay,7,9,13,4

And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.,Phoebe Buffay,7,10,1,22
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.,Rachel Green,7,10,1,23

"Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!",Monica Geller,7,10,2,10
"Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.",Phoebe Buffay,7,10,2,11
Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?,Chandler Bing,7,10,2,12
"Yeah, why not?",Phoebe Buffay,7,10,2,13
"Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.",Chandler Bing,7,10,2,14
"Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?",Phoebe Buffay,7,10,2,15
"No reason, except...she...told...me.",Chandler Bing,7,10,2,16
"Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?",Phoebe Buffay,7,10,2,17
"No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.",Chandler Bing,7,10,2,18
"Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.",Monica Geller,7,10,2,19
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?,Phoebe Buffay,7,10,2,20
"Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.",Monica Geller,7,10,2,21
"Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. Kind of what 'probably' really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, ""Your mom probably won't kill herself,"" y'know?

"I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.",Monica Geller,7,10,4,3
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.,Chandler Bing,7,10,4,5
Is this because of the burrito thing?,Chandler Bing,7,10,4,7
You need to give him money.,Monica Geller,7,10,4,8

"Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.",Chandler Bing,7,10,4,11
You've got to be smooth about it.,Monica Geller,7,10,4,12
"Hey, I can be smooth. Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.",Chandler Bing,7,10,4,13
Okay.,Chandler Bing,7,10,4,15
How did it go?,Monica Geller,7,10,4,16
Had the money in the wrong hand.,Chandler Bing,7,10,4,17

"Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?",Ross Geller,7,10,5,6
"Yes, but also Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.",Ross Geller,7,10,5,8
"Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.",Ross Geller,7,10,5,10
"Okay, that's right, yes, but on Hanukkah, uh, we sing, uh Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.",Ross Geller,7,10,5,12
"Okay, it's not a contest.",Ross Geller,7,10,5,14
"Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?",Ross Geller,7,10,5,16
"No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.",Ross Geller,7,10,5,18

"It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!",Monica Geller,7,10,6,2
How do you know so much about this?,Chandler Bing,7,10,6,3
I don't know.,Monica Geller,7,10,6,4
"Richard used to do it, didn't he?",Chandler Bing,7,10,6,5

Hey Pheebs!,Chandler Bing,7,10,8,7
Hey!,Phoebe Buffay,7,10,8,8
"If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?",Chandler Bing,7,10,8,9
"It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!"" I mean, it is so annoying.",Monica Geller,7,10,8,10
"Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.",Phoebe Buffay,7,10,8,11
"Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?",Monica Geller,7,10,8,12
Maybe on some level.,Phoebe Buffay,7,10,8,13
"Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.",Rachel Green,7,10,9,2
What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?,Joey Tribbiani,7,10,9,3
"Hey, Joey, I got you another present.",Phoebe Buffay,7,10,9,4
"Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?",Joey Tribbiani,7,10,9,5
"It's a...tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?",Phoebe Buffay,7,10,9,6
"What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?",Rachel Green,7,10,9,7
"Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!",Joey Tribbiani,7,10,9,8
"Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.",Rachel Green,7,10,9,9
"Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.",Phoebe Buffay,7,10,9,10
"What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?",Rachel Green,7,10,9,11
Our apartment is ready.,Phoebe Buffay,7,10,9,12
And that makes you angry because...,Rachel Green,7,10,9,13
Because you would rather live here with Joey.,Phoebe Buffay,7,10,9,14
Where did you get that?,Rachel Green,7,10,9,15
Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.,Phoebe Buffay,7,10,9,16
Phoebe?,Rachel Green,7,10,9,17
Hm?,Phoebe Buffay,7,10,9,18
"Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!",Rachel Green,7,10,9,19
Fish!,Phoebe Buffay,7,10,9,20
"It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.",Rachel Green,7,10,9,21
"Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here...",Phoebe Buffay,7,10,9,22
"Oh, it's so much more fun with you.",Rachel Green,7,10,9,23
"We did have fun, didn't we?",Phoebe Buffay,7,10,9,24

"Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.",Phoebe Buffay,7,10,9,26
"Oh, I would love to!",Rachel Green,7,10,9,27
"Yay, okay!",Phoebe Buffay,7,10,9,28
"Good, good, good, good, good.",Rachel Green,7,10,9,29
"Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.",Phoebe Buffay,7,10,9,30
Um... Done!,Rachel Green,7,10,9,31
Hey!,Ross Geller,7,10,10,2
"No, these are my pants.",Ross Geller,7,10,10,4
"Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?",Ross Geller,7,10,10,6
"Okay look, do-do, you have anything Christmassy? I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him, um, come on, I...uh, you gotta have something.",Ross Geller,7,10,10,8
I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!,Ross Geller,7,10,11,2
"What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?",Monica Geller,7,10,11,3
Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.,Ross Geller,7,10,11,4
"Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from...Texas.",Monica Geller,7,10,11,5
"That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.",Ross Geller,7,10,11,7
"You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!",Ross Geller,7,10,11,10
"You are? Me, too!",Ross Geller,7,10,11,12
Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?,Monica Geller,7,10,11,13
"You wanna wander in the hall? Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?",Ross Geller,7,10,11,14
Yeah!,Ross Geller,7,10,11,16
Come on Ben.,Monica Geller,7,10,11,17
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...,Ross Geller,7,10,11,19
"Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!",Chandler Bing,7,10,11,20
Hey!,Chandler Bing,7,10,11,22
"What are you doing here, Santa?",Ross Geller,7,10,11,23
"Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?",Chandler Bing,7,10,11,24
"I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?",Ross Geller,7,10,11,25
What?,Chandler Bing,7,10,11,26
"You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!",Chandler Bing,7,10,11,28
"Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.",Monica Geller,7,10,11,29
What are you doing?,Ross Geller,7,10,11,31
"You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!",Chandler Bing,7,10,11,32
"Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.",Ross Geller,7,10,11,33
Why?,Chandler Bing,7,10,11,34
"Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.",Ross Geller,7,10,11,35
But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.,Chandler Bing,7,10,11,36
"I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.",Ross Geller,7,10,11,37
"Fine, I'll give the suit back.",Chandler Bing,7,10,11,38
"Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?",Monica Geller,7,10,11,40
Santa? Really?,Chandler Bing,7,10,11,41
"Yes, is that okay?",Monica Geller,7,10,11,42
Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?,Chandler Bing,7,10,11,43
No.,Monica Geller,7,10,11,44
Then it's okay!,Chandler Bing,7,10,11,45
"Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!",Ross Geller,7,10,11,46
"Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!",Chandler Bing,7,10,11,48
"Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.",Ross Geller,7,10,11,50
"Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?",Chandler Bing,7,10,11,51
"All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.",Ross Geller,7,10,11,54
Merry Christmas!,Joey Tribbiani,7,10,11,56

"Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?",Rachel Green,7,10,12,6
Yeah?,Phoebe Buffay,7,10,12,7
And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?,Rachel Green,7,10,12,8
Yeah?,Phoebe Buffay,7,10,12,9
Do you really not know where I'm going with this? It left! It's one huge room!,Rachel Green,7,10,12,10
Oh no! Oh! Wow!!!,Phoebe Buffay,7,10,12,11
See?,Rachel Green,7,10,12,12
"Well, I guess we'll just have to put the wall back up.",Phoebe Buffay,7,10,12,13
"You can't, because of the new skylight!",Rachel Green,7,10,12,14
There's a skylight?! Wow!!,Phoebe Buffay,7,10,12,15
So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?,Rachel Green,7,10,12,16
"Y'know I'm-I'm sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.",Phoebe Buffay,7,10,12,17
Oh yeah? Startin' to feel her again there are we?,Rachel Green,7,10,12,18
"A little bit, yeah.",Phoebe Buffay,7,10,12,19

Oh me too.,Phoebe Buffay,7,10,12,25
"I know. Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I'm gettin' something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?",Rachel Green,7,10,12,26
"No, I do not hear that.",Phoebe Buffay,7,10,12,27
"...and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should've just lasted just one day, burned for...",Ross Geller,7,10,13,2
"That's right, and that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.",Ross Geller,7,10,13,4
Yeah?,Ross Geller,7,10,13,6
My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.,Chandler Bing,7,10,13,7
"The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it's time to light the Hanukkah candles!",Ross Geller,7,10,13,8

I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.,Chandler Bing,7,11,1,8
"Why, why not?",Rachel Green,7,11,1,9
Because it's too delicious.,Chandler Bing,7,11,1,10
"Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.",Rachel Green,7,11,1,11
"No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.",Chandler Bing,7,11,1,12
"Oh, I'm sorry what?",Rachel Green,7,11,1,13
"All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.",Joey Tribbiani,7,11,2,2
So...,Chandler Bing,7,11,2,3
"Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that's not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?",Joey Tribbiani,7,11,2,4
Absolutely!,Phoebe Buffay,7,11,2,5
I'll see you at 8:00.,Joey Tribbiani,7,11,2,6
Okay.,Phoebe Buffay,7,11,2,7
"Oh, what's at 8:00?",Chandler Bing,7,11,2,8
"Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.",Phoebe Buffay,7,11,2,9
"Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?",Ross Geller,7,11,2,10
Duly noted.,Phoebe Buffay,7,11,2,11
"Thanks. Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?",Ross Geller,7,11,2,12
What are you talking about?,Monica Geller,7,11,2,13
"Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night.",Ross Geller,7,11,2,14
You were invited?!,Monica Geller,7,11,2,15
No.,Ross Geller,7,11,2,16
"My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!",Monica Geller,7,11,2,17
"Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.",Chandler Bing,7,11,2,18
"Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.",Ross Geller,7,11,2,19
"Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.",Monica Geller,7,11,2,20
"Y'know, she tried to undress me too.",Ross Geller,7,11,2,21
I used to undress my cousin Glenn.,Chandler Bing,7,11,2,22
Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!,Phoebe Buffay,7,11,3,2
"Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?",Rachel Green,7,11,3,3
"Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.",Phoebe Buffay,7,11,3,4
"""Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy."" Big Daddy?",Rachel Green,7,11,3,5
Oh that's a nickname we were trying out.,Phoebe Buffay,7,11,3,6

Hey!,Joey Tribbiani,7,11,3,8
Oh! Here's Joseph Francis!,Phoebe Buffay,7,11,3,9
Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!,Joey Tribbiani,7,11,3,10
So what?! That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!,Phoebe Buffay,7,11,3,11
"Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!",Joey Tribbiani,7,11,3,12
"Phoebe he's right, that is the rule.",Ross Geller,7,11,3,13
"I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!",Phoebe Buffay,7,11,3,14
Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.,Joey Tribbiani,7,11,3,15
"Well, it does.",Phoebe Buffay,7,11,3,16
"Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I'm sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I'll pay for myself!",Joey Tribbiani,7,11,3,17
"Okay, you wore me down.",Phoebe Buffay,7,11,3,18
"Hey Joe, while you're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?",Ross Geller,7,11,3,19
The Ross-Is that back?!!,Joey Tribbiani,7,11,3,20
Hi!,Rachel Green,7,11,4,2
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!,Chandler Bing,7,11,4,3
"So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?",Rachel Green,7,11,4,4
I can't seem to say goodbye.,Chandler Bing,7,11,4,5
"Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?",Rachel Green,7,11,4,6
Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!,Chandler Bing,7,11,4,7
"It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!",Rachel Green,7,11,4,8
Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.,Chandler Bing,7,11,4,9
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.,Rachel Green,7,11,4,10
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?,Chandler Bing,7,11,4,11
"Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.",Rachel Green,7,11,4,12
Awww! Mel Torme died.,Joey Tribbiani,7,11,5,2
"Joey, that paper's like a year old!",Monica Geller,7,11,5,3

Hey.,Ross Geller,7,11,5,5
Hey.,Joey Tribbiani,7,11,5,6
Hey.,Monica Geller,7,11,5,7
"So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn't a mistake. Ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall.",Ross Geller,7,11,5,8
Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!,Monica Geller,7,11,5,9
"Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.",Ross Geller,7,11,5,10
"Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!",Monica Geller,7,11,5,11
"Oh what's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.",Ross Geller,7,11,5,12
Joan?,Monica Geller,7,11,5,13
"Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!",Ross Geller,7,11,5,14
"Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got ""and guest?!""",Monica Geller,7,11,5,15
"Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back...",Joey Tribbiani,7,11,5,16
Not broad backed!,Ross Geller,7,11,5,17
"Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!",Monica Geller,7,11,5,18
What? I can't cancel on Joan!,Ross Geller,7,11,5,19
Why not?!,Monica Geller,7,11,5,20
"Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?",Ross Geller,7,11,5,21
"Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.",Monica Geller,7,11,5,22
"Okay, all right, I'll take you. I'll go call Joan.",Ross Geller,7,11,5,23
"Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.",Joey Tribbiani,7,11,5,24
We'll see.,Monica Geller,7,11,5,25
"Well, thank you for lunch.",Chandler Bing,7,11,6,2
"What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!",Rachel Green,7,11,6,3
So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?,Chandler Bing,7,11,6,4
Its still there!,Rachel Green,7,11,6,5
Mrs. Braverman must be out.,Chandler Bing,7,11,6,6
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.,Rachel Green,7,11,6,7
"By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.",Chandler Bing,7,11,6,8
No that could kill her.,Rachel Green,7,11,6,9
"Well, we don't want that.",Chandler Bing,7,11,6,10
No so we're protecting her.,Rachel Green,7,11,6,11
But we should take it.,Chandler Bing,7,11,6,12
But we should move quick.,Rachel Green,7,11,6,13
Why?,Chandler Bing,7,11,6,14
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.,Rachel Green,7,11,6,15
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!,Chandler Bing,7,11,6,16
Oh my God! That's David!,Phoebe Buffay,7,11,7,2
David who?,Monica Geller,7,11,7,3
"David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!",Phoebe Buffay,7,11,7,4
"Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.",Phoebe Buffay,7,11,7,6
David! What-what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?,Phoebe Buffay,7,11,7,8
Well... Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?,Phoebe Buffay,7,11,7,10
Yeah.,Phoebe Buffay,7,11,7,12
Uh-huh.,Phoebe Buffay,7,11,7,14
"Well, of course I would want to see you. I...I think about you all the time.",Phoebe Buffay,7,11,7,16
Really?,Phoebe Buffay,7,11,7,18

"Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.",Phoebe Buffay,7,11,7,31
So! He'll understand!,Monica Geller,7,11,7,32
"No he won't. And that's not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y'know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don't have my principles, I don't have anything!",Phoebe Buffay,7,11,7,33
"God, you are so strong.",Monica Geller,7,11,7,34
Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!,Phoebe Buffay,7,11,7,35
Oh my God! That is so good!,Rachel Green,7,11,8,2
"I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.",Chandler Bing,7,11,8,3
Hey!,Joey Tribbiani,7,11,8,4

Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!,Monica Geller,7,11,9,3

"God Joey, this is taking forever!",Phoebe Buffay,7,11,10,23
What's the rush? What?,Joey Tribbiani,7,11,10,24
W-w-I just-it's that-I have-y'know I have-I have an appointment. And it's very important.,Phoebe Buffay,7,11,10,25

Well... It's a date.,Phoebe Buffay,7,11,10,27
"A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!",Joey Tribbiani,7,11,10,28
"Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.",Phoebe Buffay,7,11,10,29

I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!,Chandler Bing,7,11,12,4
"Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!",Rachel Green,7,11,12,5
"Y'know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm takin' it back!",Chandler Bing,7,11,12,6

"What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.",Rachel Green,7,11,12,16
What do we use to split it?,Chandler Bing,7,11,12,17
"Okay! All right, pick a half.",Rachel Green,7,11,12,18
"Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured...",Chandler Bing,7,11,12,19
Oh for God sake just pick a piece!,Rachel Green,7,11,12,20
"All right, I'll pick that one.",Chandler Bing,7,11,12,21

"Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.",Ross Geller,7,11,13,8
Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.,Monica Geller,7,11,13,9
That bitch!,Ross Geller,7,11,13,10
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!,Monica Geller,7,11,13,12
"Hi Frannie, congratulations.",Ross Geller,7,11,13,13
"You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!",Monica Geller,7,11,13,14
So it's really a question of who could you have possibly done.,Ross Geller,7,11,13,17
Are you sure? I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like...,Phoebe Buffay,7,11,14,3
That's really beautiful. What does it mean?,Phoebe Buffay,7,11,14,5
"That's good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.",Phoebe Buffay,7,11,14,7
You're right! You're right. Don't say it.,Phoebe Buffay,7,11,14,9
I do too.,Phoebe Buffay,7,11,14,11
"Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.",Phoebe Buffay,7,11,14,13
"No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and I...remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just... Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?",Joey Tribbiani,7,11,14,14
No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.,Phoebe Buffay,7,11,14,15
"Hey, y'know you could always visit him.",Joey Tribbiani,7,11,14,16
"Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport.",Phoebe Buffay,7,11,14,17
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.,Joey Tribbiani,7,11,14,18

"No. No, you can't.",Rachel Green,7,12,1,11
Oh I don't-I don't know.,Rachel Green,7,12,1,13
"Man, look at all those stars! Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn't it?",Ross Geller,7,12,1,14
Y'know what else makes you wonder?,Joey Tribbiani,7,12,1,15
Huh?,Ross Geller,7,12,1,16

"No, I'm not!",Chandler Bing,7,12,2,3
Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?,Joey Tribbiani,7,12,2,4
Because it's flattering! Come on Monica! Come on Monica!,Chandler Bing,7,12,2,5
"Yeah actually, I think we're gonna take off too. We rented a movie.",Rachel Green,7,12,2,6
"Oh! I won't say, 'no' to a movie!",Phoebe Buffay,7,12,2,7
"Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.",Rachel Green,7,12,2,8
Shh! Get me out of here.,Phoebe Buffay,7,12,2,9
Oh.,Rachel Green,7,12,2,10

"Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it's time the velvet ropes came down.",Monica Geller,7,13,4,3
They kept your room for a while.,Ross Geller,7,13,4,4
"Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogues, not a gym!",Monica Geller,7,13,4,5
"Come on, you know they love you.",Ross Geller,7,13,4,6

That was me and Ross.,Monica Geller,7,13,4,15
Oh that's right!,Phoebe Buffay,7,13,4,16

Oh that's a great idea. You're really good on the phone.,Monica Geller,7,13,4,18

Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.,Joey Tribbiani,7,13,10,15
"Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y'know, start the heeling process?",Rachel Green,7,13,10,16
"Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!",Joey Tribbiani,7,13,10,17
That's weird.,Rachel Green,7,13,10,18

It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.,Rachel Green,7,13,10,20

"Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?",Rachel Green,7,13,15,6
Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?,Chandler Bing,7,13,15,7
I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.,Rachel Green,7,13,15,8
That's awesome! That's great! What made you do it?!,Chandler Bing,7,13,15,9
"Well, it's a long story, but umm I broke Joey's chair...",Rachel Green,7,13,15,10
Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey's chair?,Chandler Bing,7,13,15,11

I think I should get the chair!,Chandler Bing,7,13,15,28
How do you figure?,Joey Tribbiani,7,13,15,30
"Because you broke a chair and you broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn't broke a chair, is me!",Chandler Bing,7,13,15,31
No-no-no! This chair's not going anywhere.,Rachel Green,7,13,15,32
"Well, where's the logic in that?!",Chandler Bing,7,13,15,33
"The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!",Rachel Green,7,13,15,34
So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!,Chandler Bing,7,13,15,35
That's right!,Joey Tribbiani,7,13,15,37

"No, it's fate!",Phoebe Buffay,7,13,16,19
"Oh. Well umm, okay here's a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.",Phoebe Buffay,7,13,16,21

"Well, y'know I'm wearing layers and it's warm.",Phoebe Buffay,7,13,16,29
"But if-no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!",Phoebe Buffay,7,13,16,31
"Y'know, I don't-I don't think it's you. This is a freaky place. Hey! Guys! Oh no, it's you.",Phoebe Buffay,7,13,16,33

"Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.",Joey Tribbiani,7,14,1,19
Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?,Ross Geller,7,14,1,20

"Y'know, I'm still 29 in Guam.",Rachel Green,7,14,1,24
"Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?",Ross Geller,7,14,1,25
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?,Rachel Green,7,14,1,26
"No Rach, it's not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.",Chandler Bing,7,14,1,27
And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!,Joey Tribbiani,7,14,1,29

"Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star.",Joey Tribbiani,7,14,2,3

"Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.",Phoebe Buffay,7,14,2,5
There you go!,Rachel Green,7,14,2,8
"I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That's it!! That's everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!! And-and girls this thing is a Godsend if you know what I mean.",Phoebe Buffay,7,14,2,10
"Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!",Rachel Green,7,14,3,2
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.,Rachel Green,7,14,3,4
"Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.",Monica Geller,7,14,3,5
Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!,Ross Geller,7,14,3,6
"How hot do I look in this, huh?!",Ross Geller,7,14,3,8
"Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?",Chandler Bing,7,14,3,9
That's not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.,Ross Geller,7,14,3,10
"Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?",Joey Tribbiani,7,14,3,11

Least of all you.,Phoebe Buffay,7,14,4,8
Weren't you asked to leave sonny?,Monica Geller,7,14,4,10
Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!,Chandler Bing,7,14,4,12
But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.,Joey Tribbiani,7,14,4,13
"Okay, for the last time. It's not named for each individual man.",Chandler Bing,7,14,4,14
"Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can't believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter! And you! I can't believe that you would have a tux that's thirty years old!",Chandler Bing,7,14,4,17
Ohh!,Chandler Bing,7,14,4,19
Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She's coming!,Rachel Green,7,14,4,20

Go change! She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.,Chandler Bing,7,14,7,17
"Ohh! All right! All right. Here's what we'll do, I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's will even notice her.",Phoebe Buffay,7,14,7,18
What's-what's going on? Phil's really pissed!,Rachel Green,7,14,7,20

Maybe that will liven up this party.,Ross Geller,7,14,7,22
"Okay, will you just go help her change please!",Chandler Bing,7,14,7,23
"Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.",Rachel Green,7,14,7,24
Yep.,Joey Tribbiani,7,14,7,25
Ahh!,Rachel Green,7,14,8,3
A scooter!,Rachel Green,7,14,8,5

No-no-no-no! That was the joke!,Chandler Bing,7,14,8,13
"No, I know! I get it! It's funny!",Rachel Green,7,14,8,14
"No, because you're not a grandmother!",Chandler Bing,7,14,8,15
"No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.",Rachel Green,7,14,8,16
All you had to do was buy the card!,Monica Geller,7,14,8,17
Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?,Ross Geller,7,14,9,2
"Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.",Rachel Green,7,14,9,3
What?,Ross Geller,7,14,9,4
Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...,Rachel Green,7,14,9,5
"Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.",Phoebe Buffay,7,14,9,6
As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!,Rachel Green,7,14,9,7
"If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.",Phoebe Buffay,7,14,9,8
"So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant...",Rachel Green,7,14,9,9
"Really! That long?! Look all you want, it's happening!",Monica Geller,7,14,9,10
"No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.",Rachel Green,7,14,9,11
Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!,Ross Geller,7,14,9,12
"No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!",Rachel Green,7,14,9,13
Will you quit hoggin' it!,Joey Tribbiani,7,14,9,15
I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.,Rachel Green,7,14,10,2
You're drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I'm a little drunk.,Ross Geller,7,14,10,3
Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.,Chandler Bing,7,14,10,5
Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?,Joey Tribbiani,7,14,10,6
How are you feeling?,Chandler Bing,7,14,10,7
"You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!",Monica Geller,7,14,10,8
I really wish that you wouldn't.,Ross Geller,7,14,10,9
"Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.",Chandler Bing,7,14,10,10
Speech! Speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl! Huh?,Phoebe Buffay,7,14,10,11
Pheebs!!,Chandler Bing,7,14,10,12
Don't you see? Everyone's looking at me! The plan's working! I didn't even have to take off my top yet!,Phoebe Buffay,7,14,10,13
Come on!,Ross Geller,7,14,10,15
I think it's necessary.,Chandler Bing,7,14,10,20
I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends...,Monica Geller,7,14,10,21
Wooo!! Hoo!!,Phoebe Buffay,7,14,10,22
"I really like to say that I'm-um... Y'know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk!! That's right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! And guess what! I've been drunk before! And I've smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It's all okay. It's okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up.",Monica Geller,7,14,10,23
"Okay quick, help me get this off!",Phoebe Buffay,7,14,10,24
Yeah!!,Joey Tribbiani,7,14,10,25
I lost a whole year! I can't believe it! This is so unfair!,Phoebe Buffay,7,14,11,2
"Oh, I don't know Pheebs. It'll be okay.",Joey Tribbiani,7,14,11,3
"Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?",Phoebe Buffay,7,14,11,4
That's not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!,Joey Tribbiani,7,14,11,5
"Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I...I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!",Phoebe Buffay,7,14,11,6

What? A brain transplant?!,Ross Geller,7,15,1,30
"Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.",Joey Tribbiani,7,15,1,31
It's ridiculous!,Ross Geller,7,15,1,32
"Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.",Joey Tribbiani,7,15,1,33
"It's winter, they are fewer people on the street.",Ross Geller,7,15,1,34
Who are they killing off?,Monica Geller,7,15,1,35

"Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?",Phoebe Buffay,7,15,2,2
"Well, I'd have to say gay.",Rachel Green,7,15,2,3
Yeah? Why?,Phoebe Buffay,7,15,2,4
Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.,Rachel Green,7,15,2,5
Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.,Phoebe Buffay,7,15,2,6
Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.,Rachel Green,7,15,2,7
Ohh knockers will help us figure it out.,Phoebe Buffay,7,15,2,8
"All right, straight, and not subtle.",Rachel Green,7,15,2,9
"Ohh, he left his cell phone.",Phoebe Buffay,7,15,2,10
"Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.",Rachel Green,7,15,2,11
Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.,Phoebe Buffay,7,15,2,12
"What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.",Rachel Green,7,15,2,13
Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.,Phoebe Buffay,7,15,2,14
What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?,Rachel Green,7,15,2,15
I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.,Phoebe Buffay,7,15,2,16
"Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.",Rachel Green,7,15,2,17
"That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex.",Phoebe Buffay,7,15,2,18
"Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.",Rachel Green,7,15,2,19
No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.,Phoebe Buffay,7,15,2,20
"Yeah! And until now, I didn't think I'd love again.",Rachel Green,7,15,2,21
Nice try.,Phoebe Buffay,7,15,2,22

"Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!",Rachel Green,7,15,2,26

"Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.",Joey Tribbiani,7,15,3,13

"No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!",Joey Tribbiani,7,15,3,17
"An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me...",Joey Tribbiani,7,15,3,19
I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?,Joey Tribbiani,7,15,3,21
"Oh uh, one of the writers.",Joey Tribbiani,7,15,3,23

Okay.,Joey Tribbiani,7,15,3,27
Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go.,Joey Tribbiani,7,15,3,29
"No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.",Rachel Green,7,15,4,2
"Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.",Phoebe Buffay,7,15,4,3
I don't think so.,Rachel Green,7,15,4,4
"Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.",Phoebe Buffay,7,15,4,5
"All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.",Rachel Green,7,15,4,6
"Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.",Phoebe Buffay,7,15,4,7
"Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.",Rachel Green,7,15,4,8
Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.,Phoebe Buffay,7,15,4,9
Yes okay. Well now see this isn't telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!,Rachel Green,7,15,4,10
"Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that's one for you.",Phoebe Buffay,7,15,4,11
"Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.",Rachel Green,7,15,4,12
"So you don't know that's Barney's the store! That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?",Phoebe Buffay,7,15,4,13
His new girlfriend!,Rachel Green,7,15,4,14
What is that?,Monica Geller,7,15,5,2

It sounds like it's coming from across the street.,Monica Geller,7,15,5,4
Oh my God!,Chandler Bing,7,15,5,5

Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours...,Chandler Bing,7,19,5,6
Yeah?,Monica Geller,7,19,5,7
"Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!",Chandler Bing,7,19,5,8
"The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!",Monica Geller,7,19,5,9
That's me! Come on!,Chandler Bing,7,19,5,10
"Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.",Monica Geller,7,19,5,11

I'll be right with you.,Chandler Bing,7,19,5,22
Cassie needs to stay at your place.,Monica Geller,7,19,6,2

Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.,Monica Geller,7,19,6,4
What?! Chandler she's our cousin!,Ross Geller,7,19,6,5
I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.,Chandler Bing,7,19,6,6
You were staring about eight inches south of there.,Monica Geller,7,19,6,7
"Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.",Ross Geller,7,19,6,8
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.,Monica Geller,7,19,6,9
"Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?",Chandler Bing,7,19,6,10
Wafer thin ice!,Monica Geller,7,19,6,11
"Hey, I'm back!",Joey Tribbiani,7,19,7,2
"Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?",Joey Tribbiani,7,19,7,4

But you told them you weren't?,Monica Geller,7,19,8,6
That's right.,Joey Tribbiani,7,19,8,7
Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?,Monica Geller,7,19,8,8
"I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.",Joey Tribbiani,7,19,8,9
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!,Monica Geller,7,19,8,10
I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.,Joey Tribbiani,7,19,8,11
"Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!",Monica Geller,7,19,8,12
I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.,Joey Tribbiani,7,19,8,13
Unless!,Monica Geller,7,19,8,14
Unless what?,Joey Tribbiani,7,19,8,15
"Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.",Monica Geller,7,19,8,16
Like what?,Joey Tribbiani,7,19,8,17
"Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.",Monica Geller,7,19,8,18
"Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.",Phoebe Buffay,7,19,9,2
"Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.",Rachel Green,7,19,9,3

"Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.",Monica Geller,7,19,9,10

I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!,Monica Geller,7,19,9,14

"Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that. Losers!",Phoebe Buffay,7,19,12,14

Ah.,Joey Tribbiani,7,19,13,9
"Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.",Monica Geller,7,19,13,10
Well maybe we just take that one away.,Joey Tribbiani,7,19,13,11
"I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.",Monica Geller,7,19,13,12
"Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.",Joey Tribbiani,7,19,13,13

"She's your cousin. She's your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she'd think you were sick! Or would she? Let's back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run, the sexiest movie ever. Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I'm going in.",Ross Geller,7,19,14,2
"Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever!

"Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...",Monica Geller,7,22,6,10
"No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y'know it's hard enough to be fourteen. You're skinny. You're wearing speedoes-That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there's your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!",Chandler Bing,7,22,6,11

"Yeah o-okay, but I'm just doing this for you.",Chandler Bing,7,22,6,17

"Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.",Joey Tribbiani,7,22,7,14
And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.,Phoebe Buffay,7,22,7,15
"Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!",Joey Tribbiani,7,22,7,16
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.,Phoebe Buffay,7,22,7,17
"Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.",Joey Tribbiani,7,22,7,18
I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.,Phoebe Buffay,7,22,7,19
Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.,Joey Tribbiani,7,22,7,20
Okay whatever.,Phoebe Buffay,7,22,7,21

What?!,Monica Geller,7,22,10,11
"Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go.",Chandler Bing,7,22,10,12

Oh my God!,Phoebe Buffay,7,23,13,24

"No Monica! I'm serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.",Rachel Green,7,24,2,31

Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.,Rachel Green,7,24,2,33
Rachel! You okay?,Monica Geller,7,24,2,34
"Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.",Joey Tribbiani,7,24,3,2

"That is an old, Chinese woman!",Ross Geller,7,24,4,4
"He could be in disguise, y'know.",Phoebe Buffay,7,24,4,5
"Aw, y'know...Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?",Ross Geller,7,24,4,6
So this is your office?,Ross Geller,7,24,4,8
How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!,Chandler Bing,7,24,4,9
What the hell are you doing?!,Phoebe Buffay,7,24,4,10
Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?,Chandler Bing,7,24,4,11

No! No! No! I can't do that!,Chandler Bing,7,24,4,13

"Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!",Chandler Bing,7,24,4,15
What's wrong with being the Bings?,Ross Geller,7,24,4,16
The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!,Chandler Bing,7,24,4,17
"Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?",Ross Geller,7,24,4,18
No.,Chandler Bing,7,24,4,19
Then you are neither of your parents!,Ross Geller,7,24,4,20
"It's not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody's! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don't race cars! I don't make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.",Chandler Bing,7,24,4,21
"But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.",Phoebe Buffay,7,24,4,22
"I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.",Chandler Bing,7,24,4,23
"Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?",Ross Geller,7,24,4,24
"Well yeah, but then...",Chandler Bing,7,24,4,25
"Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?",Ross Geller,7,24,4,26
Depends on what you mean by we.,Chandler Bing,7,24,4,27
The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And that's every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again...,Rachel Green,7,24,5,2

"Well, Joey probably thinks I'll just embarrass him. Y'know, he thinks I'm some kind of a soap opera nut-Which I'm not! I'm not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. And uh, and that your-your dog's name is Wally. Well look at that, I'm just stroking your arm.",Rachel Green,8,5,3,27

I...I have to fire him.,Monica Geller,8,5,4,5
But why?!,Phoebe Buffay,8,5,4,6
"Because he's terrible! Okay, he's slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!",Monica Geller,8,5,4,7
"Well maybe he was just nervous, y'know you can be very intimidating. And besides I've met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.",Phoebe Buffay,8,5,4,8
"Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.",Monica Geller,8,5,4,9
"But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?",Phoebe Buffay,8,5,4,10
"All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!",Monica Geller,8,5,4,11
"That's fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.",Phoebe Buffay,8,5,4,12
I paid to have this done.,Monica Geller,8,5,4,13

"Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.",Joey Tribbiani,8,5,5,6
"Oh! Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?",Rachel Green,8,5,5,7
I said no.,Joey Tribbiani,8,5,5,8
What?!,Rachel Green,8,5,5,9
What? I...I just figured since you're pregnant you're not gonna be seeing people.,Joey Tribbiani,8,5,5,10
"Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?",Rachel Green,8,5,5,11
I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.,Joey Tribbiani,8,5,5,12
"Good-good, don't tell him. Don't tell him. Just have him call me okay?",Rachel Green,8,5,5,13
"Rach look, I really don't think that's such a great...",Joey Tribbiani,8,5,5,14
"Okay, you go do it! I'll come back to that set! I'll meet more actors! I'll meet 'em all!",Rachel Green,8,5,5,15
Hey Bob.,Chandler Bing,8,5,6,2

"Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don't know if he has what it takes.",Chandler Bing,8,5,6,12
But this is eleven. It's almost twice as hard up here.,Chandler Bing,8,5,6,14
I think it's best sir.,Chandler Bing,8,5,6,16
"Y'know what you should do, just toss 'em in the shedder and claim you never got 'em.",Chandler Bing,8,5,6,18
What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!,Chandler Bing,8,5,6,20
Hey!,Phoebe Buffay,8,5,7,2
"Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!",Monica Geller,8,5,7,3
But...,Phoebe Buffay,8,5,7,4
"No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, ""Ha-ha! Gotcha!""",Monica Geller,8,5,7,5
"Okay. Okay, but you can't fire him today.",Phoebe Buffay,8,5,7,6
Why not?!,Monica Geller,8,5,7,7
Because I'm dumping him today.,Phoebe Buffay,8,5,7,8
What?! You said he was sweet!,Monica Geller,8,5,7,9
"He is sweet. He's too sweet. He calls me all the time. ""So did-did you get home from work okay?"" ""Did-did you get out of the shower okay?""",Phoebe Buffay,8,5,7,10
Just don't pick up your phone.,Monica Geller,8,5,7,11
"Then he comes over! ""I'm so worried about you."" Uck! Be a man!",Phoebe Buffay,8,5,7,12
What? So now I'm not allowed to fire him?,Monica Geller,8,5,7,13
"You can't fire him and dump him the same day, he'll kill himself.",Phoebe Buffay,8,5,7,14
"Okay well then, I'll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.",Monica Geller,8,5,7,15
"Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I'll kill myself!",Phoebe Buffay,8,5,7,16
"Okay well, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it!",Monica Geller,8,5,7,17
Okay. But the question is who's gonna go first. 'Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.,Phoebe Buffay,8,5,7,18
What do you mean?,Monica Geller,8,5,7,19
"Come on! The boss that fires a guy that's just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that's just been fired, blond bitch!",Phoebe Buffay,8,5,7,20
I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.,Monica Geller,8,5,7,21
"All right, that makes sense. Ugh. But-Screw you I'm going first!",Phoebe Buffay,8,5,7,22
"Sure, what's up?",Chandler Bing,8,5,8,3
"Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I'm not drinking on this date tonight. ""Umm, I'm a recovering alcoholic. I'm a Mormon,"" or ""I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk?""",Rachel Green,8,5,9,2
Hey!,Ross Geller,8,5,9,3

A date?,Ross Geller,8,5,9,10
Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?,Rachel Green,8,5,9,11
"Why no, it's the opposite of weird. It's-it's uh, regular. It's-it's uh, it's mundane. It's actually uh, a little dull.",Ross Geller,8,5,9,12
It's no Ukrainian film.,Joey Tribbiani,8,5,9,13
Yeah-Ooh! Earrings!,Rachel Green,8,5,9,14

You set her up?!,Ross Geller,8,5,9,17
No,Joey Tribbiani,8,5,9,18
Joey what-what were you thinking?!,Ross Geller,8,5,9,19
"Well, I was thinking that it'd probably be okay because Ross hasn't gone out with Rachel in five years!",Joey Tribbiani,8,5,9,20
"Joey, I'm not worried about her! I'm worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this actor taking them?",Ross Geller,8,5,9,21
Hey! I'm an actor too! I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.,Joey Tribbiani,8,5,9,22
A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!,Ross Geller,8,5,9,23
Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?,Joey Tribbiani,8,5,9,24
Why don't they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that's a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That's fun too! Whew!!,Ross Geller,8,5,9,25
"Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.",Joey Tribbiani,8,5,9,28

"All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it's like enough!",Joey Tribbiani,8,5,11,4
"Well, I tell you what. Why don't we uh, why don't we just stay here? Let's not see a movie, we'll just hang.",Ross Geller,8,5,11,5
And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?,Joey Tribbiani,8,5,11,6
"Hey, if that's what you want to do I'm not gonna say no.",Ross Geller,8,5,11,7

I just-I-I can't believe she's-she's dating?!,Ross Geller,8,5,11,13
"Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?",Joey Tribbiani,8,5,11,14
I don't know! I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.,Ross Geller,8,5,11,15
What do you mean?,Joey Tribbiani,8,5,11,16
"It's just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan's, it's like-It breaks my heart a little. I mean I've always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y'know? Maybe fight over the science section.",Ross Geller,8,5,11,17
That's a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!,Joey Tribbiani,8,5,11,18
No! No I can't. I mean Rachel's out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.,Ross Geller,8,5,11,19
"Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?",Joey Tribbiani,8,5,11,20
It used to be. Now she doesn't really have a face. Smokin' body though.,Ross Geller,8,5,11,21
"Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn't Rachel.",Joey Tribbiani,8,5,11,22
No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?,Ross Geller,8,5,11,23
"I know, but I don't think that's what she wants.",Joey Tribbiani,8,5,11,24
"No, it's not what I want either. I mean I-I can't force myself to fall in love with her again now.",Ross Geller,8,5,11,25
"That's okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It's not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there's gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?",Joey Tribbiani,8,5,11,26
Yeah.,Ross Geller,8,5,11,27
"Hey, I tell you what. Let's you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!",Joey Tribbiani,8,5,11,28

"Yeah and-and I'm sorry too. But, well I just-I like things done a certain way and the chemistry's just not right.",Monica Geller,8,5,13,15
"Oh that's good, the chemistry thing for us too.",Phoebe Buffay,8,5,13,16
Tim wait!,Monica Geller,8,5,13,18
"Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-there's a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again.",Monica Geller,8,5,13,20

"Well better than you, but y'know still not what you want.",Rachel Green,8,5,14,9

"Yeah I know. On the other hand in um, in about seven months you're gonna have something that you're gonna love more than any guy you've ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea.",Ross Geller,8,5,14,25

That means nothing to me. Come on!,Chandler Bing,8,6,4,25

That's not so bad.,Joey Tribbiani,8,6,5,68
"No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just awful with children!",Rachel Green,8,6,5,69
"Come on! You're good with kids. They're just crazy on Halloween. Y'know, they're all greedy and hopped up on sugar!",Joey Tribbiani,8,6,5,70
Really? You think that's all it is?,Rachel Green,8,6,5,71

"Y'know uh, I didn't actually do this.",Chandler Bing,8,7,1,6
"Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?",Monica Geller,8,7,1,7
"No, it wasn't you.",Chandler Bing,8,7,1,8
Well then who?,Monica Geller,8,7,1,9
I got a maid. Yay!,Chandler Bing,8,7,1,10
"I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then...",Monica Geller,8,7,1,11
"Uh honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control...",Chandler Bing,8,7,1,12
"Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!",Monica Geller,8,7,1,13
"Look, she's really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.",Chandler Bing,8,7,1,14
Did she really say that?,Monica Geller,8,7,1,15
"Yes, I distinctly remember 'cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?",Chandler Bing,8,7,1,16
"Fine, I can do it. Whew.",Monica Geller,8,7,1,17
What's the matter?,Chandler Bing,8,7,1,18
"Well, usually when I'm this anxious, I clean!",Monica Geller,8,7,1,19

Wow! What did he do?,Rachel Green,8,7,2,11
Shhh! I'm talking.,Phoebe Buffay,8,7,2,12
Are you asking me out? 'Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.,Phoebe Buffay,8,7,2,14
No! Wait! I was just saying that so you'd think I was a good person. Fight for me.,Phoebe Buffay,8,7,2,16
"Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours.",Phoebe Buffay,8,7,2,18
"I've got friends too. Okay, bye.",Phoebe Buffay,8,7,2,20
"Oh my God! I'm going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can't make lunch.",Phoebe Buffay,8,7,2,23
So apparently I'm available for lunch.,Ross Geller,8,7,2,24
I can't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.,Rachel Green,8,7,2,25
You're moving?,Ross Geller,8,7,2,26
"Yeah, I can't live with Joey once the baby comes. I don't want my child's first words to be, ""How you doin'?""",Rachel Green,8,7,2,27
So does-does Joey know you're moving?,Ross Geller,8,7,2,28
"Well, I haven't discussed it with him yet, but I know he's gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.",Rachel Green,8,7,2,29
That's not really porn.,Ross Geller,8,7,2,30
Not so much.,Rachel Green,8,7,2,31
"Hey, y'know what and if you're looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.",Ross Geller,8,7,2,32
Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?,Rachel Green,8,7,2,33
"Well I don't know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want. With your permission.",Ross Geller,8,7,2,34
Yeah that would really be great.,Rachel Green,8,7,2,35
Yeah.,Ross Geller,8,7,2,36
Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn't. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.,Rachel Green,8,7,2,37
Yeah. No. No you're right.,Ross Geller,8,7,2,38
Shall we?,Rachel Green,8,7,2,40
Yeah.,Ross Geller,8,7,2,41
Hi. I'm Ross Geller. I live in the building.,Ross Geller,8,7,3,3
"And I'm Rachel, an admirer of the building.",Rachel Green,8,7,3,4
I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I'm so sorry for your loss.,Ross Geller,8,7,3,5
What?,Ross Geller,8,7,3,7
"Oh, thank God!",Ross Geller,8,7,3,9

"Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in the laundry room.",Ross Geller,8,7,3,13
Y'know I would it's just painful.,Ross Geller,8,7,3,15
So she's really not dead.,Rachel Green,8,7,3,16
"Hmm. Do you think-Could you tell me if she's hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?",Rachel Green,8,7,3,18
"Oh well umm, I make it myself! It's two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is...y'know what? We just met.",Monica Geller,8,7,4,3
I love her.,Monica Geller,8,7,4,5
Okay.,Monica Geller,8,7,4,7
See? I told you.,Chandler Bing,8,7,4,8
She stole my jeans!,Monica Geller,8,7,4,9
What?,Chandler Bing,8,7,4,10
I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!,Monica Geller,8,7,4,11
So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?,Chandler Bing,8,7,4,12
Don't you see? It's the perfect crime!,Monica Geller,8,7,4,13
She must've been planning this for years!,Chandler Bing,8,7,4,14
I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!,Monica Geller,8,7,4,15
"Honey, isn't it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?",Chandler Bing,8,7,4,16
I guess.,Monica Geller,8,7,4,17
"So, shouldn't we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go...snooping around her crotch?",Chandler Bing,8,7,4,18
Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give her my secret ingredient.,Monica Geller,8,7,4,19
"Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?",Chandler Bing,8,7,4,20
Yeah!,Monica Geller,8,7,4,21
Hi!,Phoebe Buffay,8,7,5,2
"Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.",Phoebe Buffay,8,7,5,4
Oh.,Phoebe Buffay,8,7,5,6
Yeah. Yeah.,Phoebe Buffay,8,7,5,8
Maybe this is too weird.,Phoebe Buffay,8,7,5,10
No don't tear out your eyes!!,Phoebe Buffay,8,7,5,12
"Oh, yeah try that. So, is that better?",Phoebe Buffay,8,7,5,14
"Look Eric, turn around. Look, I like you, but it shouldn't be this hard. Y'know? This is our first date y'know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and 'Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?' and y'know first kisses and......second kisses.",Phoebe Buffay,8,7,5,16
"Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.",Ross Geller,8,7,6,2
"Yeah, we're done.",Ross Geller,8,7,6,4
Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?,Ross Geller,8,7,6,6
"Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?",Joey Tribbiani,8,7,6,7
Really?!,Ross Geller,8,7,6,8
"No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.",Joey Tribbiani,8,7,6,9
Sweet!,Ross Geller,8,7,6,10
"All right, well finish your coffee; let's go.",Joey Tribbiani,8,7,6,11
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.,Ross Geller,8,7,6,12
"To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you're not gonna be on TV!",Joey Tribbiani,8,7,6,13
"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.",Ross Geller,8,7,6,14
"Oh, you're switching apartments?",Joey Tribbiani,8,7,6,15
"It's not for me, it's for Rachel.",Ross Geller,8,7,6,16
But Rachel has an apartment.,Joey Tribbiani,8,7,6,17
"Yeah, but when the baby comes she's gonna want to move.",Ross Geller,8,7,6,18
She is?,Joey Tribbiani,8,7,6,19
"Yeah, you didn't expect her to live there with a baby did you?",Ross Geller,8,7,6,20
I guess I didn't really think about it.,Joey Tribbiani,8,7,6,21
Ezel! Hey Gunther! You're an ezel!,Ross Geller,8,7,6,22
Damnit!,Ross Geller,8,7,6,24
Nice jeans!,Monica Geller,8,7,7,2
Oh. You're not gettin' it.,Monica Geller,8,7,7,4
"Oh, I fell asleep.",Monica Geller,8,7,7,7
"Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That'll really work up your appetite for lunch.",Monica Geller,8,7,7,9
Hello.,Monica Geller,8,7,7,12
"I'm sorry. I've never had a maid before, is this not okay?",Monica Geller,8,7,7,14
Hey!,Rachel Green,8,7,8,2
Hey!,Joey Tribbiani,8,7,8,3
How was the game?,Rachel Green,8,7,8,4
"Oh, okay. I...I ate way too much.",Joey Tribbiani,8,7,8,5
Oh.,Rachel Green,8,7,8,6
"Ooh. So umm, I was talkin' to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.",Joey Tribbiani,8,7,8,7
Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.,Rachel Green,8,7,8,8
I was kinda hoping you'd stay.,Joey Tribbiani,8,7,8,9
"Oh but Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here.",Rachel Green,8,7,8,10
"No room? It's a baby. It's like this big. Y'know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. Or-or-or we could put it right here. Aw, it's cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here. You wouldn't even notice it. Where's the baby?",Joey Tribbiani,8,7,8,11
"Honey, it's not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there's a screaming baby around.",Rachel Green,8,7,8,12
I could use a challenge! It's getting pretty easy.,Joey Tribbiani,8,7,8,13
"Honey, it's so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can't do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.",Rachel Green,8,7,8,14
I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn't have to change.,Joey Tribbiani,8,7,8,15
I know.,Rachel Green,8,7,8,16
Y'know I blame Ross for this.,Joey Tribbiani,8,7,8,17
I do too a little bit.,Rachel Green,8,7,8,18
"I'm gonna miss you, you're the hottest roommate I ever had.",Joey Tribbiani,8,7,8,19
"Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.",Phoebe Buffay,8,7,9,2
"No, I got in trouble for that before. I'll see you later.",Phoebe Buffay,8,7,9,4
Really? That's the thing I'm worse at! You'll see.,Phoebe Buffay,8,7,9,6
Hi!,Chandler Bing,8,7,10,2
"Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.",Monica Geller,8,7,10,3
How come?,Chandler Bing,8,7,10,4
Because I put my head between her legs.,Monica Geller,8,7,10,5
To see her pants?,Chandler Bing,8,7,10,6
They're my pants!,Monica Geller,8,7,10,7
Are you sure? Did you see the stain?,Chandler Bing,8,7,10,8
No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.,Monica Geller,8,7,10,9
"God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?",Chandler Bing,8,7,10,10
Fine. She's wearing my bra!,Monica Geller,8,7,10,11
Oh dear God!,Chandler Bing,8,7,10,12
My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!,Monica Geller,8,7,10,13
And yet you don't recognize that you're crazy.,Chandler Bing,8,7,10,14
Here's the plan! Okay? I'm going to leave you get a look at Brenda's bra!,Monica Geller,8,7,10,15
Here's another plan...No!,Chandler Bing,8,7,10,16
I would do it but she thinks I'm attracted to her!,Monica Geller,8,7,10,17
Why?,Chandler Bing,8,7,10,18
Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we're a team! We're in this together!,Monica Geller,8,7,10,19
I fear a jury will see it the same way!,Chandler Bing,8,7,10,20
"Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman's breasts all the time!",Monica Geller,8,7,10,21
You see that?,Chandler Bing,8,7,10,22
Do you see this?,Monica Geller,8,7,10,23
All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it's not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!,Chandler Bing,8,7,10,24
"Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you'll know it's mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there's a very noticeable rip.",Monica Geller,8,7,10,25
You need new clothes.,Chandler Bing,8,7,10,26
Hi. How is she?,Ross Geller,8,7,11,2
"Oh. Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some bloemen.",Ross Geller,8,7,11,4

You didn't notice she was wearing different clothes?!,Phoebe Buffay,8,7,12,16
Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y'know what? This is too weird.,Phoebe Buffay,8,7,12,18
So I guess this is it.,Phoebe Buffay,8,7,12,20
"Yeah, so do you.",Phoebe Buffay,8,7,12,22
I'm leaning. This is where I lean.,Chandler Bing,8,7,13,3
Brenda a bee!,Chandler Bing,8,7,13,5
Yes! It's flown into your blouse and you'd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!,Chandler Bing,8,7,13,7
You do?,Chandler Bing,8,7,13,9
I totally understand. Can I just see your bra?,Chandler Bing,8,7,13,11
Hi!,Rachel Green,8,7,14,2
Where did you get those jeans?!,Monica Geller,8,7,14,3
You gave them to me!,Rachel Green,8,7,14,4
No I didn't!,Monica Geller,8,7,14,5
"All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.",Rachel Green,8,7,14,6
Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!,Monica Geller,8,7,14,7

"Joey, are you sure?",Rachel Green,8,7,15,14

"I thought we weren't gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y'know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.",Chandler Bing,8,8,1,23

"I'm sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!",Monica Geller,8,8,1,25
Well you could've untied it with your hands.,Rachel Green,8,8,1,26

You went home with the waitress.,Chandler Bing,8,8,1,28
"Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.",Joey Tribbiani,8,8,1,29

Rachel!,Phoebe Buffay,8,8,2,15
"No it's okay, this is what's gonna happen. I'm gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.",Rachel Green,8,8,2,16
"Why, so he can get mad at the baby?",Phoebe Buffay,8,8,2,17
"Hey, that is the...baby's problem. Oh, everything okay with the waiter?",Rachel Green,8,8,2,18

"Come on! Come on, it'll be fun! It'll make me feel so much better.",Monica Geller,8,8,3,26
"Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it's a little creepy. Y'know? I'm not a bachelor anymore.",Chandler Bing,8,8,3,27
"So don't think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a...a two month anniversary present.",Monica Geller,8,8,3,28
"Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance!",Ross Geller,8,8,3,29
Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!,Monica Geller,8,8,3,30
All right fine! But I'm only doing this for you!,Chandler Bing,8,8,3,31

"I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn't want him to start yelling at me like I was some '74 Latour.",Rachel Green,8,8,4,3
It's Lafite. The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.,Phoebe Buffay,8,8,4,4
"All right here he comes. I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna be strong.",Rachel Green,8,8,4,5

Okay. I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.,Chandler Bing,8,8,5,5
How does it feel knowing you're never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you're gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.,Joey Tribbiani,8,8,5,6
"You're right, this is more fun.",Chandler Bing,8,8,5,7
"That's her! Okay, come on!",Joey Tribbiani,8,8,5,9

"Uh, that-that's-that's me!",Joey Tribbiani,8,8,5,13

"Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.",Joey Tribbiani,8,8,5,15
"Yeah, yeah right over there.",Chandler Bing,8,8,5,17
That was weird.,Chandler Bing,8,8,5,19
Why-why would she go in the bedroom?,Joey Tribbiani,8,8,5,20
So she's a...,Chandler Bing,8,8,5,23
"Yeah, that's one naked hooker!",Joey Tribbiani,8,8,5,24

"Aw forget it, it's from Pier One. Sorry.",Ross Geller,8,8,6,8
Y'know this is actually not a great time for me.,Ross Geller,8,8,6,10

"No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care-I-I love Rachel.",Ross Geller,8,8,7,8
"Oh but not that way. I mean...I mean I'm not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.",Ross Geller,8,8,7,10
Hey! I offered to marry her!,Ross Geller,8,8,7,12
But I didn't want to.,Ross Geller,8,8,7,14
"I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.",Ross Geller,8,8,7,17
I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!,Chandler Bing,8,8,8,2
"Wait! Wait! Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she's supposed to do.",Joey Tribbiani,8,8,8,3
"Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. Ma'am, are you also a stripper?",Chandler Bing,8,8,8,4
"Maybe Monica's playing a joke on ya. Y'know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that's pretty funny.",Joey Tribbiani,8,8,8,6
"That is funny, maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone.",Chandler Bing,8,8,8,7
I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.,Joey Tribbiani,8,8,8,8
"Oh actually, I'd rather you...Yeah, go ahead. We're gonna have to burn that room down anyway.",Chandler Bing,8,8,8,10
"I was going to tell you, but...",Ross Geller,8,8,9,3
Hey! I did not dump Rachel! Nor are we still together. Can I just... Why don't we just let the machine get that?,Ross Geller,8,8,9,5
Hey Ross. It's Joey. There's a hooker over here and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.,Joey Tribbiani,8,8,9,6
"No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I-I need to, I need to lie down.",Ross Geller,8,8,9,7
Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl's number.,Monica Geller,8,8,10,3
My husband.,Monica Geller,8,8,10,5
She's a stripper.,Monica Geller,8,8,10,7
"Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?",Monica Geller,8,8,10,9
Oh my God Stu! I-I can't believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she's a hooker?,Monica Geller,8,8,10,11
Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.,Joey Tribbiani,8,8,11,2
Why would she do that?,Chandler Bing,8,8,11,3
"Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you're really bad at y'know, sexually?",Joey Tribbiani,8,8,11,4
This is the worst bachelor party ever!,Chandler Bing,8,8,11,5
In a minute!,Joey Tribbiani,8,8,11,7
In a minute? What's gonna happen in a minute?!,Chandler Bing,8,8,11,8
"All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.",Joey Tribbiani,8,8,11,9
Why me?!,Chandler Bing,8,8,11,10

"No, I-I miss hanging out with you.",Joey Tribbiani,8,8,11,19
Well we...we still hang out.,Chandler Bing,8,8,11,20
Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y'know now it's like...things are different.,Joey Tribbiani,8,8,11,21
"Well y'know, things are different. I'm...I'm married now.",Chandler Bing,8,8,11,22
"Oh sure-And hey, don't get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just...I miss...hanging out...just-just us, y'know?",Joey Tribbiani,8,8,11,23
"Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we'll make time to hang out with each other.",Chandler Bing,8,8,11,24
You got it. Come here.,Joey Tribbiani,8,8,11,25
"She's a hooker! She's a hooker! She's a... Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone.",Monica Geller,8,8,11,27
So your dad dropped by. He's a pleasant man!,Ross Geller,8,8,12,2

I'D Better Go. Just Over Here I don't want to miss the fight.,Phoebe Buffay,8,8,12,4
"Ross I'm so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.",Rachel Green,8,8,12,5
I don't care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she's totally freaked out!,Ross Geller,8,8,12,6
"Oh okay, I'll fix that to. What's her e-mail address?",Rachel Green,8,8,12,7

"That's it?! You call that a fight? Come on! ""We were on a break!"" ""No we weren't!"" What happened to you two?!",Phoebe Buffay,8,8,12,13
Thank you so much for coming back over.,Ross Geller,8,8,13,2
"I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I'm so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You're gonna have to tell me how you did that.",Rachel Green,8,8,13,4
Focus.,Ross Geller,8,8,13,5
"Okay. Um...But-Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.",Rachel Green,8,8,13,6
Oh we just-we drove each other crazy!,Rachel Green,8,8,13,8

"I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!",Rachel Green,8,8,13,10
Trying to date this woman.,Ross Geller,8,8,13,11
"Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is.",Rachel Green,8,8,13,12
Probably shouldn't touch me.,Ross Geller,8,8,13,13
"I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single? I am so gonna leave right now.",Rachel Green,8,8,13,15
Should I leave this open for you too?,Ross Geller,8,8,13,16
Because what's going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.,Ross Geller,8,8,13,18
"I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel's father. Look I...I made a mistake, but it's only because I really, really like you. Really!",Ross Geller,8,8,13,20
"Forgot my purse! Oh, you guys made up. He's a good kisser isn't he? I'm going!",Rachel Green,8,8,13,22

Could you not narrate?,Chandler Bing,8,8,14,10
Gotcha sailor.,Monica Geller,8,8,14,11
"Wow, you told your dad the truth.",Phoebe Buffay,8,8,15,3
About an hour ago.,Rachel Green,8,8,15,4
Wanna go see a movie?,Phoebe Buffay,8,8,15,5
Yes! Bye daddy.,Rachel Green,8,8,15,6
Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions! What gives you the right to... Go to hell! Stupid guy on my phone.,Joey Tribbiani,8,8,15,8
"Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.",Joey Tribbiani,8,9,1,2
Oh my...God! Let me see that!,Rachel Green,8,9,1,3
You fall for it every time!,Joey Tribbiani,8,9,1,4
Hey!,Phoebe Buffay,8,9,1,5
Hi!,Rachel Green,8,9,1,6
I brought you my old maternity clothes!,Phoebe Buffay,8,9,1,7
"Oh Pheebs that's so sweet--Ooh, those are so cute!",Rachel Green,8,9,1,8
"Yeah! And look, see how they expand as the baby grows? And then after the baby's born, they're great for shoplifting melons.",Phoebe Buffay,8,9,1,9
"Oh good you're all here. Thanksgiving tomorrow, four o'clock. Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?",Monica Geller,8,9,1,10
No.,Rachel Green,8,9,1,11
"He was in Ross's class...marching band...kinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.",Monica Geller,8,9,1,12
"Wow! I don't remember him. Honey, are you sure you're not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.",Rachel Green,8,9,1,13
"No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven't thought about him in a long time... Anyway, umm Will's, Will's here on business and he didn't have a place to go so I invited him here.",Monica Geller,8,9,1,14
Oh that's nice.,Rachel Green,8,9,1,15
"Oh, and by the way, he's lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! I still love Chandler.",Monica Geller,8,9,1,16
I just want you to say it once in a while.,Joey Tribbiani,8,9,1,17
"All right okay, just so you know, I'm not gonna make a turkey this year.",Monica Geller,8,9,1,18
What?!,Joey Tribbiani,8,9,1,19
Well Phoebe doesn't eat turkey...,Monica Geller,8,9,1,20
Phoebe!,Joey Tribbiani,8,9,1,21
"Turkey's are beautiful, intelligent animals!",Phoebe Buffay,8,9,1,22
No they're not! They're ugly and stupid and delicious!,Joey Tribbiani,8,9,1,23
"All right! Okay, it's just Phoebe. Will's still on a diet, Chandler doesn't eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel's having her aversion to poultry.",Monica Geller,8,9,1,24
She is?,Joey Tribbiani,8,9,1,25
Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?,Rachel Green,8,9,1,26
Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.,Joey Tribbiani,8,9,1,27
"Anyway, it just doesn't seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It's a lot of work.",Monica Geller,8,9,1,28
"But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!",Joey Tribbiani,8,9,1,29
All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just-there's gonna be a ton left over.,Monica Geller,8,9,1,30
No there won't! I promise I will finish that turkey!,Joey Tribbiani,8,9,1,31
"All right, you're telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?",Monica Geller,8,9,1,32
"That's right! 'Cause I'm a Tribbiani! And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don't read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!",Joey Tribbiani,8,9,1,33
"Hey, isn't weird to think about how next year at this time they'll be a little baby at the table? Rachel's! But good to know where you're at!",Monica Geller,8,9,2,2
Hey!,Phoebe Buffay,8,9,2,3
Hey!,Monica Geller,8,9,2,4
Happy Thanksgiving!,Phoebe Buffay,8,9,2,5
You too!,Monica Geller,8,9,2,6
Anything I can do to help?,Phoebe Buffay,8,9,2,7
"Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he's really into the game so I don't want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins?",Monica Geller,8,9,2,8
Sure!,Phoebe Buffay,8,9,2,9
I'm gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.,Monica Geller,8,9,2,10
Okay.,Phoebe Buffay,8,9,2,11
"No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We're not at a barn dance. You've gotta-you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?",Monica Geller,8,9,2,12
"Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me. So how's the game?",Phoebe Buffay,8,9,2,13

"Look Rach I-I'm sorry, okay? I...I was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined...",Ross Geller,8,9,3,15
...co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn't handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.,Ross Geller,8,9,3,17
Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?,Rachel Green,8,9,3,19

I don't care how long ago it was! You told people that I was half and half! Y'know what? I just want to point out I never did anything to hurt you in high school.,Rachel Green,8,9,3,55
That's not totally true.,Monica Geller,8,9,3,56

"So how did this happen? Did she, did she lure you to an early bird dinner?",Phoebe Buffay,8,9,3,73
"I was working late in the library one afternoon. It was just the two of us. She needed some help with her word jumble. And one thing led to another. If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender. May she rest in peace...",Ross Geller,8,9,3,74
Didn't she walk with a cane?,Monica Geller,8,9,3,75
Only when it was damp!! I can't believe you-you told people about this?! Everybody knew?! Y'know what? I'm back in the club!,Ross Geller,8,9,3,76
I wanna join!,Phoebe Buffay,8,9,3,78

"All right, y'know-Fine! You guys have your stupid little club, but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie!",Rachel Green,8,9,3,81
"All right, listen you're just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!",Monica Geller,8,9,3,82
Wow...,Rachel Green,8,9,3,83
"And Ross, if it weren't for Rachel's rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!",Monica Geller,8,9,3,84

Wait! But Ross if they don't get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.,Phoebe Buffay,8,10,3,27

"Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don't really go with it.",Monica Geller,8,10,5,12
"You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!",Chandler Bing,8,10,5,13
"Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I'll wear the boots. In fact, I'll go into my room right now and y'know try the outfit on.",Monica Geller,8,10,5,14
Okay.,Chandler Bing,8,10,5,15
Okay? Ooo wee! Christmas party in my boots!,Monica Geller,8,10,5,16
"Honey, it's going to be okay. He's been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that's what the meatball sub is for.",Rachel Green,8,10,6,3
Okay.,Rachel Green,8,10,6,5
Hey! It's my fashion girls! What's wrong?,Joey Tribbiani,8,10,6,7
"Honey, why don't you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.",Rachel Green,8,10,6,8
"Oh. What's, what's going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dad's heart? Is that a sandwich?",Joey Tribbiani,8,10,6,9
Is that a sandwich?!,Joey Tribbiani,8,10,6,11
Joey...there's something that you...should know. Dina?,Rachel Green,8,10,6,12
What?!,Joey Tribbiani,8,10,6,14
Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich!,Rachel Green,8,10,6,15
Well obviously this is a mistake! You can't be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!,Joey Tribbiani,8,10,6,16
What?! Dina...,Rachel Green,8,10,6,18
Bub!!! I can't believe this! You're the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!,Joey Tribbiani,8,10,6,19
"You got pregnant for funny?! Dina...if he's funny...laugh! All right, I'll be back in a little while! You stay here!",Joey Tribbiani,8,10,6,21
I can't look at you right now!,Joey Tribbiani,8,10,6,23
I know.,Rachel Green,8,10,6,25
"Oh, there you are Ben!",Phoebe Buffay,8,10,7,2
"Well, I heard you're having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy's name is Sting's son.",Phoebe Buffay,8,10,7,4
"Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.",Phoebe Buffay,8,10,7,6
Him you're friends with.,Phoebe Buffay,8,10,7,8
"Yes! Yes you can, I'm looking for Jack's parents.",Phoebe Buffay,8,10,7,10
"Uh-huh, I'm with Ben.",Phoebe Buffay,8,10,7,12
"I am one of Ben's mothers. I'm a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.",Phoebe Buffay,8,10,7,14
Oh.,Phoebe Buffay,8,10,7,16
Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.,Phoebe Buffay,8,10,7,18
"Yeah! Let's do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?",Phoebe Buffay,8,10,7,20
"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? 'Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. She's such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.",Phoebe Buffay,8,10,7,22
"Y'know, that party wasn't bad.",Chandler Bing,8,10,8,2
Yeah! I didn't know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!,Monica Geller,8,10,8,3
"I don't see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?",Chandler Bing,8,10,8,4
"Oh no, we can't walk!",Monica Geller,8,10,8,5
"What honey, it's like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let's go.",Chandler Bing,8,10,8,6
Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?,Monica Geller,8,10,8,7
What's going on?,Chandler Bing,8,10,8,8
I can't walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!,Monica Geller,8,10,8,9
What?,Chandler Bing,8,10,8,10
"Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They're killing me! One toe at a time!",Monica Geller,8,10,8,11
So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right. It's oddly unsettling.,Chandler Bing,8,10,8,12
How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?,Monica Geller,8,10,8,13
Hop on.,Chandler Bing,8,10,8,14
"Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first. Ah...Ooh...Oohh...Ohh...Oh God...Ohh...Oh...Ohh...Ohhhh...",Monica Geller,8,10,8,15
"Honey, I know you're in pain right now, but I'm a little turned on.",Chandler Bing,8,10,8,16
What college was that Dina?,Rachel Green,8,10,9,3
"Joey, what are you doing?",Rachel Green,8,10,9,7
"Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman...",Joey Tribbiani,8,10,9,8
Oh Joey this is crazy!,Rachel Green,8,10,9,9
"Don't interrupt me when I'm talkin' to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man...",Joey Tribbiani,8,10,9,10
Oh you'll take 'em!,Joey Tribbiani,8,10,9,12
Hey! You don't get a say in this!,Joey Tribbiani,8,10,9,14
"Ahhh! I heard ""I do"", we're halfway there! Okay! You!",Joey Tribbiani,8,10,9,16
"All right Joey! That is enough! Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it's not legal. Okay? They-they don't have a marriage license, they don't have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!",Rachel Green,8,10,9,17
Well what am I supposed to do?,Joey Tribbiani,8,10,9,19
You're supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.,Rachel Green,8,10,9,20
No they can't! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!,Joey Tribbiani,8,10,9,21
Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective! Right?,Rachel Green,8,10,9,22
"Oh, come on kids! A little help here!",Rachel Green,8,10,9,24
Wow! This place is incredible! Sting's pen...that he gave to Phoebe. Come on! Secret passageway!,Phoebe Buffay,8,10,10,2
Hi!,Phoebe Buffay,8,10,10,4
Uh-huh.,Phoebe Buffay,8,10,10,6
Why else would I be here?,Phoebe Buffay,8,10,10,8
Uh-huh.,Phoebe Buffay,8,10,10,10
Yeah.,Phoebe Buffay,8,10,10,12
"Umm, I'm sorry. Won't-won't Jack's father be joining us?",Phoebe Buffay,8,10,10,14
"Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o'clock?",Phoebe Buffay,8,10,10,16
"Concert. Yeah. That does put us in...quite a pickle. Because you see I'm very busy before and after the concert, and he's obviously busy during.",Phoebe Buffay,8,10,10,18
"Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.",Phoebe Buffay,8,10,10,20
"Oh, thank you. Four would be great.",Phoebe Buffay,8,10,10,22
Oh good! Then you're in luck! Ben's not my son!,Phoebe Buffay,8,10,10,24
The Police? Here? A reunion?!,Phoebe Buffay,8,10,10,26
"Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.",Chandler Bing,8,10,11,2
Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!,Monica Geller,8,10,11,3
Oh I'm sorry! Do you need a break?,Chandler Bing,8,10,11,4
My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?,Monica Geller,8,10,11,5
I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.,Chandler Bing,8,10,11,6
"Okay, I'm sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.",Monica Geller,8,10,11,7
I don't have your boots.,Chandler Bing,8,10,11,8
Well I don't have them either. Where are they?,Monica Geller,8,10,11,9
"Well, why don't you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!",Chandler Bing,8,10,11,10
"Okay. God well, we gotta go back and get them!",Monica Geller,8,10,11,11
"Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?",Chandler Bing,8,10,11,12
"Okay, I'm never gonna wear them again. I just didn't get a chance to say goodbye.",Monica Geller,8,10,11,13
Y'know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.,Chandler Bing,8,10,11,14
Okay. All right.,Monica Geller,8,10,11,15
Okay.,Chandler Bing,8,10,11,16
Bye boots-Wait! Half off?!,Monica Geller,8,10,11,17
"Joey, just because they're not getting married doesn't mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!",Rachel Green,8,10,12,2
"Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let's hear their plan! Now, what's the future look like for Dina and Bobby?",Joey Tribbiani,8,10,12,3
You were right. He is funny.,Joey Tribbiani,8,10,12,5
"Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don't you tell us a little bit about your band?",Rachel Green,8,10,12,6
Really?,Rachel Green,8,10,12,8
"Dina, if you're having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby! Dude, that's not a compliment!",Joey Tribbiani,8,10,12,9
So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You're gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself...without a husband?! You can't be a single mother alone! You're gonna ruin your life!,Joey Tribbiani,8,10,12,11
Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?,Rachel Green,8,10,12,12
No! No! No! It's different for you. You're so strong and together. You're not some dumb kid who doesn't know what she's doing.,Joey Tribbiani,8,10,12,13
"One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.",Joey Tribbiani,8,10,12,15
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?,Rachel Green,8,10,12,16
"Maybe! Well! Well...so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts-Oh forget it! I can't!",Joey Tribbiani,8,10,12,17
Because! 'Cause... 'Cause you're my baby sister!,Joey Tribbiani,8,10,12,21
"Well I'd be scared of them, but all right.",Joey Tribbiani,8,10,12,23
Of course he's gonna have his Uncle Joey!,Joey Tribbiani,8,10,12,25
That's right! By his uncle too!,Joey Tribbiani,8,10,12,27
"Okay Bobby, why don't we just come over here and let them have a little moment.",Rachel Green,8,10,12,29
Come here!,Joey Tribbiani,8,10,12,30
No! Seriously! What's wrong with you?!,Rachel Green,8,10,12,31
You're gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!!,Ross Geller,8,10,13,2
Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!,Phoebe Buffay,8,10,13,3
Well...let's just say... Rosss caaaaan!,Ross Geller,8,10,13,4
"Oo, where are the seats?",Phoebe Buffay,8,10,13,5
"Uh, middle balcony.",Ross Geller,8,10,13,6
"Okay, now would you say that that's more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?",Phoebe Buffay,8,10,13,7
Yeah.,Ross Geller,8,10,13,8
Then that's not breaking the law! I'm there!,Phoebe Buffay,8,10,13,9
Yeah?,Phoebe Buffay,8,11,1,3
"Look at that guy by the window, wow!",Rachel Green,8,11,1,4
"He's awfully short and I think he's talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.",Phoebe Buffay,8,11,1,5
"Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it's like every guy I see-I mean look here. Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that's not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I'm feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.",Rachel Green,8,11,1,6
"Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?",Phoebe Buffay,8,11,1,7
Yeah.,Rachel Green,8,11,1,8
"This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.",Phoebe Buffay,8,11,1,9
Really?! So this has happened to you?,Rachel Green,8,11,1,10
"Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y'know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.",Phoebe Buffay,8,11,1,11
"Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa's lap.",Rachel Green,8,11,1,12
"Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.",Phoebe Buffay,8,11,1,13
Ah.,Rachel Green,8,11,1,14
Yeah.,Phoebe Buffay,8,11,1,15
"Well, y'know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, I'll ask her about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.",Rachel Green,8,11,1,16
"Yeah. Yeah, that's what you need a good...pill.",Phoebe Buffay,8,11,1,17
Hi!,Ross Geller,8,11,2,3
"Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?",Ross Geller,8,11,2,5
"Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.",Joey Tribbiani,8,11,2,6
Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?,Ross Geller,8,11,2,7
I'm missin' picture time?!,Joey Tribbiani,8,11,2,9
Y'know she has a face Ross!,Phoebe Buffay,8,11,2,10
"Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y'know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.",Ross Geller,8,11,2,12
Together? Like-like to people?,Ross Geller,8,11,2,14
Okay.,Ross Geller,8,11,2,16
"Uh sure, sure.",Ross Geller,8,11,2,18
Bye.,Phoebe Buffay,8,11,2,20
Congratulations! You just got married!,Joey Tribbiani,8,11,2,22
I know. Can you believe that?,Ross Geller,8,11,2,23
"Wait, I'm-I'm sorry. What's the big deal about a holiday card?",Phoebe Buffay,8,11,2,24
"Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!",Ross Geller,8,11,2,25
"Hey-hey-hey, hey that's your wife you're talking about!",Joey Tribbiani,8,11,2,26
"Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?",Chandler Bing,8,11,3,3
"Yes, hi.",Monica Geller,8,11,3,4
"I didn't know you and Carol were getting divorced, I'm sorry.",Chandler Bing,8,11,3,6
No leg-chewing for us sir.,Monica Geller,8,11,3,8
I can't think of anything we're doing. Why can't I think of anything we're doing?,Monica Geller,8,11,3,10
"Okay, I'll see you tomorrow! Just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow. I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?",Monica Geller,8,11,3,12
No.,Chandler Bing,8,11,3,13
That's because he wasn't invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.,Monica Geller,8,11,3,14
"Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn't it?",Chandler Bing,8,11,3,15
Hey!,Ross Geller,8,11,4,3
"Huh. Wow, this is great.",Ross Geller,8,11,4,5
"Well, we-we haven't said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay to say it to other people.",Ross Geller,8,11,4,7
"A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I'll take a-Mona, uh...I-I'm not sure about the whole uh, card thing.",Ross Geller,8,11,4,9
"Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don't know if we're really quite there yet.",Ross Geller,8,11,4,11
Yeah.,Ross Geller,8,11,4,13
Huh.,Ross Geller,8,11,4,15
Hmm...,Ross Geller,8,11,4,17
Let's do the card!,Ross Geller,8,11,4,20
The card! I think we're there!,Ross Geller,8,11,4,22
"Really?! I mean, even with the card?",Ross Geller,8,11,4,24
Hi!,Rachel Green,8,11,5,3
"Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? Y'know who I'm talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers...",Rachel Green,8,11,5,5
"Yes, you are.",Rachel Green,8,11,5,7
"Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do?",Rachel Green,8,11,5,9
"Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?",Rachel Green,8,11,5,11
"Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!",Rachel Green,8,11,5,13
No. I'm very comfortable.,Rachel Green,8,11,5,15
"No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!",Rachel Green,8,11,5,17
Well would you like me to lie down on the table?,Rachel Green,8,11,5,19
Do you feel it too?,Rachel Green,8,11,5,21
Hi.,Rachel Green,8,11,6,2
"Oh hey! So, how did your doctor's appointment go?",Phoebe Buffay,8,11,6,3
"Well, let's see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.",Rachel Green,8,11,6,4
Oh my God.,Phoebe Buffay,8,11,6,5
Why did you do that?,Monica Geller,8,11,6,6
"Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?",Phoebe Buffay,8,11,6,7
"Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.",Monica Geller,8,11,6,8
You wish.,Phoebe Buffay,8,11,6,9
"Hey, I could've had you if I wanted you.",Monica Geller,8,11,6,10
Oh yeah? Come and get it.,Phoebe Buffay,8,11,6,11
"Okay, even this is turning me on!",Rachel Green,8,11,6,12
Hey!,Ross Geller,8,11,6,13
"Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how's it, how's it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?",Rachel Green,8,11,6,14
"Oh yeah, yeah we're moving forward. You'll be getting our card!",Ross Geller,8,11,6,15
You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?,Monica Geller,8,11,6,16
"Yeah, we're not just doing a card! Y'know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.",Ross Geller,8,11,6,17
Ugh! Women!,Phoebe Buffay,8,11,6,18
"I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, ""So, where is this going?""",Ross Geller,8,11,6,19
Uh Ross? You asked me that.,Rachel Green,8,11,6,20
"Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I'm not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I'm horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y'know, something that says we're moving forward without having to talk about it.",Ross Geller,8,11,6,21
Like asking her to move in with you?,Monica Geller,8,11,6,22
Smaller than that.,Ross Geller,8,11,6,23
Making her a mixed tape?,Monica Geller,8,11,6,24
"Uh, bigger than that.",Ross Geller,8,11,6,25
Give her a key to your apartment.,Phoebe Buffay,8,11,6,26
Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.,Ross Geller,8,11,6,27
"All right. Have you said, ""I love you?"" You could say, I love you.",Monica Geller,8,11,6,28
"Yeah I-I don't-I don't think I'm quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you.",Ross Geller,8,11,6,29
"No, we hate that.",Phoebe Buffay,8,11,6,30
That is a slap in the face.,Monica Geller,8,11,6,31
"Forget it. I-I-Y'know what? I'll just have the conversation. I'll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?",Ross Geller,8,11,6,32
"I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.",Rachel Green,8,11,6,33
"Oh uh, as it turns out, we can't do it. Monica has to work.",Chandler Bing,8,11,7,3
Oh uh well tomorrow's no good for her either.,Chandler Bing,8,11,7,5
It's the semi-finals...of her...botchy ball tournament.,Chandler Bing,8,11,7,7
Well now-now you're just talking crazy.,Chandler Bing,8,11,7,9
Because uh...we-we...we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.,Chandler Bing,8,11,7,11
Y'know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?,Chandler Bing,8,11,7,13
"Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. But to hell with that bitch.",Chandler Bing,8,11,7,15
"Here we go. Mona umm, I think it's time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.",Ross Geller,8,11,8,2
"Aw, we-we are so... So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y'know hanging out with you. And I mean-I'm having a lot of fun.",Ross Geller,8,11,8,4
"I mean, there's no point in spending time with someone if-if it's just fun. It's gotta be, it's gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going? Ah! That's-that's the real question. And-and the answer is...is it's going somewhere...fun. Now I-I know what you're thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y'know, but you're-you're not getting any younger. No I mean-No not you, not you, you-you are getting younger. I mean-you-you look like you're getting younger by the second-What's your secret?",Ross Geller,8,11,8,6
"Well, well to sum up, we're having fun, you look young.",Ross Geller,8,11,8,8
But that's not enough. So... So...here's a key to my apartment.,Ross Geller,8,11,8,10
Really.,Ross Geller,8,11,8,12
You gave her a key to your apartment?!,Rachel Green,8,11,9,2
"Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.",Ross Geller,8,11,9,3
Hey. Ooh Ross! How'd the conversation go?,Phoebe Buffay,8,11,9,4
"Oh great, I live on the street.",Ross Geller,8,11,9,5
Where?!,Phoebe Buffay,8,11,9,6
Hey!,Rachel Green,8,11,9,7
"Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.",Phoebe Buffay,8,11,9,8
Hi Roger.,Monica Geller,8,11,9,10
"So umm, I'm gonna get us some drinks. Would you help me out?",Phoebe Buffay,8,11,9,11
Yeah.,Rachel Green,8,11,9,12
"Umm, he's here to have sex with you.",Phoebe Buffay,8,11,9,13
What?,Rachel Green,8,11,9,14
You're welcome.,Phoebe Buffay,8,11,9,15
Phoebe no!,Rachel Green,8,11,9,16
"It's okay, he's a virgin.",Phoebe Buffay,8,11,9,17
"Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he'll have sex with you.",Monica Geller,8,11,9,18
"Yeah, okay let's leave these two alone.",Phoebe Buffay,8,11,9,19
"No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!",Rachel Green,8,11,9,20
Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!,Phoebe Buffay,8,11,9,21
"Oh that's all right sir, and that's just one girl.",Chandler Bing,8,11,10,3
It's a hand. It's a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.,Chandler Bing,8,11,10,5
Oh no-no-no!,Chandler Bing,8,11,10,7
"Okay, and oh I'm gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.",Ross Geller,8,11,11,2
No. That guy is.,Ross Geller,8,11,11,4
I'm trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.,Ross Geller,8,11,11,8
I love you!,Ross Geller,8,11,11,10
Hi honey I'm home.,Chandler Bing,8,11,12,2
From the tequila factory?,Monica Geller,8,11,12,3
"It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn't give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!",Chandler Bing,8,11,12,4
Come here. I can breath through my mouth.,Monica Geller,8,11,12,5
"Y'know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It's a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.",Chandler Bing,8,11,12,6
"I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?",Monica Geller,8,11,12,7
"Ooh, I don't know if we're there yet.",Chandler Bing,8,11,12,8
"Yes. Hi, I'd like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question? Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch. I'll call you back.",Rachel Green,8,11,13,2

"Ah... Hey, so this roommate of yours...is he good looking?",Joey Tribbiani,8,12,4,11
Hm-mmm.,Rachel Green,8,12,4,12
"Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?",Joey Tribbiani,8,12,4,13
"Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.",Rachel Green,8,12,4,14
"No-no-no-no, he's not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!",Joey Tribbiani,8,12,4,15

Because it's awesome.,Chandler Bing,8,12,8,11
You think this is clever?,Monica Geller,8,12,8,12

"Hey wait a minute, this one isn't dirty.",Monica Geller,8,12,8,14
It is when you put it together with that one.,Chandler Bing,8,12,8,15

"I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.",Joey Tribbiani,8,12,9,11
Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.,Rachel Green,8,12,9,12

"More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! I didn't say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just tell me!",Joey Tribbiani,8,12,9,25
"Okay. All right, stand up. Well, when we're at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, ""Hmmm."" Okay, I know it doesn't sound like anything, but I swear it works.",Rachel Green,8,12,9,26
"Yeah. Why-Yeah, that would work for ya...",Joey Tribbiani,8,12,9,27

"Well, why didn't you just take a cab?",Rachel Green,8,12,10,4

"So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. Here. Here. Now as for the hydrosaurs...",Ross Geller,8,12,16,2
"All right. It's a new day. All that stuff about Rachel, you don't feel that now. It was crazy! You're fine. You're better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Grrrreat! Everything's normal! She's just your friend Rachel! Your friend Rachel. Your friend! Rachel.",Joey Tribbiani,8,13,1,2

Hi.,Monica Geller,8,13,2,2
"Are you, are you high?",Chandler Bing,8,13,2,3
I just had the most amazing bath.,Monica Geller,8,13,2,4
Really? I don't like baths.,Chandler Bing,8,13,2,5
"Wait, you like them with me.",Monica Geller,8,13,2,6
"Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy, it's the wet, naked lady.",Chandler Bing,8,13,2,7
"Oh, baths are so relaxing!",Monica Geller,8,13,2,8
Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.,Chandler Bing,8,13,2,9
"How dirty do you think I am? I'm telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.",Monica Geller,8,13,2,10
"Honey, it's 2:00 on a Wednesday and I'm watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?",Chandler Bing,8,13,2,11
"Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.",Joey Tribbiani,8,13,2,12
"Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?",Chandler Bing,8,13,2,13
"Well, neither.",Joey Tribbiani,8,13,2,14
"Oh my God, what's up?!",Chandler Bing,8,13,2,15
"I don't know. It's-it's just...lately, I've been feeling... Okay, here's what it is... You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks!",Joey Tribbiani,8,13,2,16
"Oh no-no, no you don't, just come back.",Chandler Bing,8,13,2,17
"All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that's different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?",Joey Tribbiani,8,13,2,18
Do you?,Chandler Bing,8,13,2,19
"It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?",Joey Tribbiani,8,13,2,20
In London?,Chandler Bing,8,13,2,21
Yeah.,Joey Tribbiani,8,13,2,22
"Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.",Chandler Bing,8,13,2,23
"You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.",Joey Tribbiani,8,13,2,24
If that.,Chandler Bing,8,13,2,25
"Hi! Oh, Ross, don't forget, we have that doctor's appointment tomorrow!",Rachel Green,8,13,3,2
Right.,Ross Geller,8,13,3,3
"Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?",Phoebe Buffay,8,13,3,4
"No-no, we talked about it. We don't want to know. All we care about is that it's happy and healthy.",Ross Geller,8,13,3,5
Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!,Rachel Green,8,13,3,6
And smart!,Ross Geller,8,13,3,7
Popular.,Rachel Green,8,13,3,8
With an aptitude for science.,Ross Geller,8,13,3,9
Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?,Phoebe Buffay,8,13,3,10
Oh yeah! I've come up with a bunch of ideas!,Rachel Green,8,13,3,11
Really? Me too!,Ross Geller,8,13,3,12
Me too!,Phoebe Buffay,8,13,3,13
Really?!,Rachel Green,8,13,3,14
"Uh huh! If it's a girl, Phoebe, and if it's a boy, Phoebo!",Phoebe Buffay,8,13,3,15
"Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach, what were you thinking?",Ross Geller,8,13,3,16
"Okay! I was thinking if it's a girl, how about Sandrine? It's French.",Rachel Green,8,13,3,17
Huh. That's a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.,Ross Geller,8,13,3,18
"Okay fine, what do you have?",Rachel Green,8,13,3,19
"Well, OK, it's for a boy. Well, I know it's a little out there, but...Darwin.",Ross Geller,8,13,3,20
"Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.",Rachel Green,8,13,3,21
"Yeah, by Sandrine.",Phoebe Buffay,8,13,3,22
You're just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!,Ross Geller,8,13,3,23
"I'm really, really not.",Rachel Green,8,13,3,24
How-how about you each get five vetoes?,Phoebe Buffay,8,13,3,25
All right.,Ross Geller,8,13,3,26
All right.,Rachel Green,8,13,3,27
That sounds fair.,Ross Geller,8,13,3,28
"Yeah! I don't think you're going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it's a girl, Rain.",Rachel Green,8,13,3,29
Veto.,Ross Geller,8,13,3,30
Why?,Rachel Green,8,13,3,31
"Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.",Ross Geller,8,13,3,32
I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!,Phoebe Buffay,8,13,3,33
"Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?",Ross Geller,8,13,3,34
"Ross, why do you hate our child?",Rachel Green,8,13,3,35
"Fine, you go.",Ross Geller,8,13,3,36
"Okay, James.",Rachel Green,8,13,3,37
Huh.,Ross Geller,8,13,3,38
But only if it's a girl.,Rachel Green,8,13,3,39
"Oh, veto. How about-Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?",Ross Geller,8,13,3,40
Oh! I'm sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?,Rachel Green,8,13,3,41
Veto. Stewart?,Ross Geller,8,13,3,42
Veto. Sawyer?,Rachel Green,8,13,3,43
Veto. Helen?,Ross Geller,8,13,3,44
Veto.,Rachel Green,8,13,3,45
"Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?",Phoebe Buffay,8,13,3,46
Hey.,Chandler Bing,8,13,4,2
"Boy, do I have a surprise for you!",Monica Geller,8,13,4,3
Sex on the balcony?,Chandler Bing,8,13,4,4
"No, but someone's really not going to get over that idea, are they?",Monica Geller,8,13,4,5
What is it?,Chandler Bing,8,13,4,6
I drew you a bath!,Monica Geller,8,13,4,7
"Honey, I don't like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?",Chandler Bing,8,13,4,8
"Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So it's a boy bath!",Monica Geller,8,13,4,9
"Well, this does butch it up a bit.",Chandler Bing,8,13,4,10
"I swear, if you try it, you will love it!",Monica Geller,8,13,4,11
"All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?",Chandler Bing,8,13,4,12
Absolutely.,Monica Geller,8,13,4,13
Bet I know how that discussion's going to go.,Monica Geller,8,13,4,15
"All right, this isn't so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because I've got my boat.",Chandler Bing,8,13,4,17
So?,Monica Geller,8,13,4,18
Oh my God.,Chandler Bing,8,13,4,19
"I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!",Monica Geller,8,13,4,20
I'm going to need a bigger boat.,Chandler Bing,8,13,4,21
"I don't think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?",Ross Geller,8,13,5,2
"Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!",Rachel Green,8,13,5,3
"Uh, no. No, we're not.",Ross Geller,8,13,5,5
But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it's a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?,Rachel Green,8,13,5,6
"No, no, we want to wait, right?",Ross Geller,8,13,5,8
Right. Right.,Rachel Green,8,13,5,9
"So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?",Rachel Green,8,13,5,11
"What? Rach! Come on, that's terrible! They're...uh...they're babies. They're-they're all beautiful.",Ross Geller,8,13,5,12
Third one from the left?,Rachel Green,8,13,5,13
"Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows I'm talking about it. Don't-don't you-Wh-Wha-Hey!!",Ross Geller,8,13,5,14
What?!,Rachel Green,8,13,5,15
You're looking!,Ross Geller,8,13,5,16
I didn't!,Rachel Green,8,13,5,17
I saw you!,Ross Geller,8,13,5,18
"Okay fine, I did. But I didn't see anything, I swear.",Rachel Green,8,13,5,19
Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!,Ross Geller,8,13,5,20
"Okay, but Ross just listen to me...",Rachel Green,8,13,5,21
"No, no, no, no! Don't tell me! I don't want to know!",Ross Geller,8,13,5,22
"But I couldn't even if I wanted to, because I don't know! I swear; I didn't see anything, and I don't want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.",Rachel Green,8,13,5,23
Momentary lapse. Don't-don't you have any self-control?,Ross Geller,8,13,5,24
"Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.",Rachel Green,8,13,5,25
Hello?,Monica Geller,8,13,6,2
"I'm in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there's something wrong.",Chandler Bing,8,13,6,3
You know what? I-I think I'll wait out here.,Monica Geller,8,13,6,4
I'm in the bathtub.,Chandler Bing,8,13,6,5
Oh. What's wrong?,Monica Geller,8,13,6,6
"I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water's tepid. The salt didn't dissolve and is now... lodged places. And the scents I used don't compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile-Oh!",Chandler Bing,8,13,6,7
What?,Monica Geller,8,13,6,8
The bath salts! They're starting to effervesce! It's different. It's interesting.,Chandler Bing,8,13,6,9
"Okay, let's talk about something else.",Monica Geller,8,13,6,10
"Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!",Chandler Bing,8,13,6,11
"Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and...",Monica Geller,8,13,6,12
I had the exact same conversation.,Chandler Bing,8,13,6,13
You did? What was he talking about?,Monica Geller,8,13,6,14
I don't know! Joey hasn't had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!,Chandler Bing,8,13,6,15
That was a long night.,Monica Geller,8,13,6,16
"All right, let's break this down. What exactly did he say to you?",Chandler Bing,8,13,6,17
"Okay, he was talking about rules.",Monica Geller,8,13,6,18
Uh-huh.,Chandler Bing,8,13,6,19
"Umm, and looking at people differently.",Monica Geller,8,13,6,20
He didn't say anything about that to me.,Chandler Bing,8,13,6,21
What did he tell you?,Monica Geller,8,13,6,22
"He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.",Chandler Bing,8,13,6,23
"Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.",Monica Geller,8,13,6,24
But what did he mean by rules?,Chandler Bing,8,13,6,25
Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!,Monica Geller,8,13,6,26
Because he was looking at her differently.,Chandler Bing,8,13,6,27
"And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!",Monica Geller,8,13,6,28
My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!,Chandler Bing,8,13,6,29
You guys?,Phoebe Buffay,8,13,6,30
Just a minute! That's Mrs. Tribbiani!,Monica Geller,8,13,6,31
You don't say anything.,Chandler Bing,8,13,6,32
"Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?",Monica Geller,8,13,6,33
I'm not going to let you say anything.,Chandler Bing,8,13,6,34
You just stay here!,Monica Geller,8,13,6,35
"Oh, God!",Chandler Bing,8,13,6,36
"Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.",Phoebe Buffay,8,13,6,38
"Oh, you had that?",Monica Geller,8,13,6,39
Uh-huh.,Phoebe Buffay,8,13,6,40
"I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.",Monica Geller,8,13,6,41
"Oh, just as well, I broke this one.",Phoebe Buffay,8,13,6,42
What?,Phoebe Buffay,8,13,6,44
Nothing.,Monica Geller,8,13,6,45
Okay.,Phoebe Buffay,8,13,6,46
"I mean, I-I, I really shouldn't say. I mean, I'm really not supposed to.",Monica Geller,8,13,6,47
Fine.,Phoebe Buffay,8,13,6,48
It's a humdinger!,Monica Geller,8,13,6,49
Then it's really too bad that you can't tell me.,Phoebe Buffay,8,13,6,50
Somebody likes you!,Monica Geller,8,13,6,51
Is it Chandler?,Phoebe Buffay,8,13,6,52
No!,Monica Geller,8,13,6,53
"Well, then tell him to stop staring!",Phoebe Buffay,8,13,6,54
It's Joey!,Monica Geller,8,13,6,55
Really?! Joey?! You don't say.,Phoebe Buffay,8,13,6,56
Is it something you'd be interested in?,Monica Geller,8,13,6,57
"I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But y'know on the other hand... No. No, I can't. We're friends. No, oh, no. I don't want to risk what we have.",Phoebe Buffay,8,13,6,58
"I guess that makes sense. So, you think you're going to talk to him?",Monica Geller,8,13,6,59
"Sure, yeah. I mean, it's Joey. I don't want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!",Phoebe Buffay,8,13,6,60
"Not Chandler, just Joey.",Monica Geller,8,13,6,61
Sure.,Phoebe Buffay,8,13,6,62
Hey.,Rachel Green,8,13,7,2
Hey.,Ross Geller,8,13,7,3
You know what? I've been thinking about it. I'm really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.,Rachel Green,8,13,7,4
"Rach, I-I can't tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know we're never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it's a boy!",Ross Geller,8,13,7,5
I didn't see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.,Rachel Green,8,13,7,6
"I don't think so! You're just giving me Ruth so you'll get to name it when it's a boy, and that's when you'll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.",Ross Geller,8,13,7,7
I would-Sequoia?,Rachel Green,8,13,7,8
Veto.,Ross Geller,8,13,7,9
Fine.,Rachel Green,8,13,7,10
"Unless... You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well, I'm not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!",Ross Geller,8,13,7,11
"But Ross, you want the name Ruth!",Rachel Green,8,13,7,12
Not like this!,Ross Geller,8,13,7,13
Hey.,Phoebe Buffay,8,13,8,2
"Hey. Well, what's up?",Joey Tribbiani,8,13,8,3
"Umm, Joey, I know.",Phoebe Buffay,8,13,8,4
What?,Joey Tribbiani,8,13,8,5
I knooow.,Phoebe Buffay,8,13,8,6
Whaaat?,Joey Tribbiani,8,13,8,7
I know about your feelings.,Phoebe Buffay,8,13,8,8
Oh my God. You do?,Joey Tribbiani,8,13,8,9
"Yes, and I'm sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that's very rare.",Phoebe Buffay,8,13,8,10
"I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it's Rachel for God sakes.",Joey Tribbiani,8,13,8,11
"For God sakes, it's Rachel!",Phoebe Buffay,8,13,8,12
I know. I know. And she's not only my friend; she's my pregnant friend! She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!,Joey Tribbiani,8,13,8,13
Yeah that's Rachel. Beat me over the head with it.,Phoebe Buffay,8,13,8,14
"What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y'know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don't like about her. You want to hear it?",Joey Tribbiani,8,13,8,15
Yeah.,Phoebe Buffay,8,13,8,16
"She made me switch to light Mayo. That's it! That's all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!",Joey Tribbiani,8,13,8,17
"Joey, I just think you're getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.",Phoebe Buffay,8,13,8,18
You think?,Joey Tribbiani,8,13,8,19
"Absolutely! Y'know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.",Phoebe Buffay,8,13,8,20
"Yeah, just a crush! That's all this is! It's a crush! I'm Joey; I don't get deep feelings.",Joey Tribbiani,8,13,8,21
"That's right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I've had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I'm sure you've had them for us.",Phoebe Buffay,8,13,8,22
Not really.,Joey Tribbiani,8,13,8,23
Mm-hmm. Throw me a bone here.,Phoebe Buffay,8,13,8,24
"So, I uh... I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby.",Ross Geller,8,13,9,2
What?,Rachel Green,8,13,9,3
That's right. The student has become the master.,Ross Geller,8,13,9,4
"Ross, I swear, I don't know.",Rachel Green,8,13,9,5
"Oh, come on, you know it's a girl!",Ross Geller,8,13,9,6
A what?!,Rachel Green,8,13,9,7
You really didn't know?,Ross Geller,8,13,9,8
We're having a girl?,Rachel Green,8,13,9,9
No.,Ross Geller,8,13,9,10
That's what you just said!,Rachel Green,8,13,9,11
No.,Ross Geller,8,13,9,12
You said girl!,Rachel Green,8,13,9,13
Yes. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.,Ross Geller,8,13,9,14
I'm not! We're having a girl! Sometimes I can't believe it's with you-But still! We're having a girl!,Rachel Green,8,13,9,15
I know! I know. You know what? I'm putting Ruth back on the table!,Ross Geller,8,13,9,16
"Oh, yes! We'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth...",Rachel Green,8,13,9,17
Permission to veto.,Ross Geller,8,13,9,18
"Yes, please.",Rachel Green,8,13,9,19
Hey.,Monica Geller,8,13,10,2
Do I smell essential oils?,Chandler Bing,8,13,10,3
"Yeah, I'm going to take a bath. I'm just going to get a magazine.",Monica Geller,8,13,10,4
Okay.,Chandler Bing,8,13,10,5
What do you think you're doing?,Monica Geller,8,13,10,7
L-leaving my troubles behind?,Chandler Bing,8,13,10,8
"I know that you're new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.",Monica Geller,8,13,10,9
"Oh, it's so hard to care when you're this relaxed.",Chandler Bing,8,13,10,10
"Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you're just a girl in a tub!",Monica Geller,8,13,10,11
Hey!,Chandler Bing,8,13,10,13
"Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.",Phoebe Buffay,8,13,10,14
You told her?!,Chandler Bing,8,13,10,15
She pulled it out of me! She's like a conversational wizard! How'd it go?,Monica Geller,8,13,10,16
"Well, you were wrong, he doesn't like me!",Phoebe Buffay,8,13,10,17
What?,Monica Geller,8,13,10,18
"Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors' house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn't like you? How would you feel?",Phoebe Buffay,8,13,10,19
I don't think I'd care.,Monica Geller,8,13,10,20
Really? Lee Majors is hot!,Phoebe Buffay,8,13,10,21
Hello?,Joey Tribbiani,8,13,10,22
We're in the bathroom!,Phoebe Buffay,8,13,10,23

"All right. It's a new day, and it's just a crush, that's all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, ""it was cuckoo!"" Everything's going to be fine. It's just a crush.",Joey Tribbiani,8,13,11,2
"Hi, sweetie.",Rachel Green,8,13,11,3
I love you.,Joey Tribbiani,8,13,11,4

"Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. Wow, you sure found that quick. I just-I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel anymore, y'know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think...I think Ross feels left out. Y'know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God... You should've seen the look on Ross's face. By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here. For all I know I'm just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?",Joey Tribbiani,8,14,8,9
That's a good idea.,Chandler Bing,8,14,8,10

"Oh, I just...I feel terrible.",Joey Tribbiani,8,14,8,13

Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.,Joey Tribbiani,8,14,10,15
"Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don't know any of it and I'm the father. I wish I'd be more involved y'know.",Ross Geller,8,14,10,16
"Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.",Rachel Green,8,14,10,17

Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?,Rachel Green,8,14,10,26

"But Joey, I don't think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I mean--Or he does.",Rachel Green,8,14,10,28

Are you okay?,Chandler Bing,8,14,12,6
"Are you kidding me? I'm great! Yeah, I'm uh; I'm better than great. I am good. And now that she's gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn't do before. Y'know? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Y'know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Y'know? I like being on my own, I'm uh, better off this way.

The red one.,Ross Geller,8,15,2,19
"Hey. Look, I know you've been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate.",Phoebe Buffay,8,15,3,2
"No, I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again.",Joey Tribbiani,8,15,3,3
He-hee!,Phoebe Buffay,8,15,3,5
"Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.",Joey Tribbiani,8,15,3,6
"This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!",Phoebe Buffay,8,15,3,7
"Thanks so much, Pheebs! We are going to have so much fun, yes we are! Oh! Not that kind of fun.",Joey Tribbiani,8,15,3,8

Hi.,Joey Tribbiani,8,15,5,6

"Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but I've got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do. Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously can't stop it.",Rachel Green,8,15,5,9
"C'mere. Hey. C'mere. That's Rachel. She's the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with you-we love her. But we can't have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? You're a guy. Well, you used to be.",Joey Tribbiani,8,15,5,10
So what do you think?,Monica Geller,8,15,6,2
I've still got it!,Monica Geller,8,15,6,4
Why did you get me this?,Chandler Bing,8,15,6,5
What is it?,Monica Geller,8,15,6,6
"It's yelling...bleeding...dilating. Oh, the dilating...",Chandler Bing,8,15,6,7
"Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe's. Why were you even watching it?",Monica Geller,8,15,6,8
I thought...maybe...you got me porn for Valentine's Day.,Chandler Bing,8,15,6,9
"Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine's Day... you were right! Apparently, it's about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! Oh, wait a minute. Those aren't stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?",Monica Geller,8,15,6,10
"Well, I'm not really in a sexy mood right now.",Chandler Bing,8,15,6,11
"Honey, what's going on?",Monica Geller,8,15,6,12
"Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?",Chandler Bing,8,15,6,13
Mm-hmm.,Monica Geller,8,15,6,14
How long it took to go back in the water?,Chandler Bing,8,15,6,15
"Chandler, we can't let this tape wreck Valentine's Day!",Monica Geller,8,15,6,16
You don't know. You didn't see it.,Chandler Bing,8,15,6,17
"Child-birth, it's a natural thing! It's beautiful.",Monica Geller,8,15,6,18
"Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful?",Chandler Bing,8,15,6,19
"Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!",Monica Geller,8,15,6,20
"See, honey, there's-",Chandler Bing,8,15,6,21
Don't touch me!,Monica Geller,8,15,6,22
"Hey! So, how was Atlantic City?",Ross Geller,8,15,7,3
Yeah?,Ross Geller,8,15,7,5
"Wha-? Oh, come on. You didn't have to-saltwater taffy?! Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it's actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That's not interesting.",Ross Geller,8,15,7,7
I do too! I missed you!,Ross Geller,8,15,7,9
"Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!",Ross Geller,8,15,7,11
Yeah! I know! It was. Oh... the only sad thing is I wasn't around when it happened for the first time.,Ross Geller,8,15,7,13
"Yeah, I'm missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.",Ross Geller,8,15,7,15
What?,Ross Geller,8,15,7,17
Huh...uh-huh.,Ross Geller,8,15,7,19
Just a second!,Ross Geller,8,15,7,23
How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?,Phoebe Buffay,8,15,8,2
"I don't know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!",Ross Geller,8,15,8,3
"Taffy, really? I've never had any.",Phoebe Buffay,8,15,8,4
Ever?!,Ross Geller,8,15,8,5
"Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. Thank you! So what, you're just never going to tell her?",Phoebe Buffay,8,15,8,6
"Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I'm going to take her to an amazing Valentine's dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I'm the best boyfriend in the world, then I'm going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.",Ross Geller,8,15,8,7
"she's a lucky, lucky lady! So, where are you going to-what the mother of crap is up with this stuff? Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food? What's the deal? Oh, it's nice! May I try a pink one?",Phoebe Buffay,8,15,8,8
"So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn't going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.",Joey Tribbiani,8,15,9,2
Hey!,Phoebe Buffay,8,15,9,3
Hey.,Joey Tribbiani,8,15,9,4
"Hey, buddy. How's my favorite dog, huh? How's my favorite dog? You're subdued. Did you give him a beer?",Phoebe Buffay,8,15,9,5
No.,Joey Tribbiani,8,15,9,6
"Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.",Phoebe Buffay,8,15,9,7
"Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Oh, me, right!",Joey Tribbiani,8,15,9,8
He's miserable! What happened to him?,Phoebe Buffay,8,15,9,10
Nothing. We just talked about stuff.,Joey Tribbiani,8,15,9,11
What stuff?,Phoebe Buffay,8,15,9,12
Rachel stuff.,Joey Tribbiani,8,15,9,13
"Oh...Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!",Phoebe Buffay,8,15,9,14
He's breathing!,Joey Tribbiani,8,15,9,15
"Okay, I'm going to take him back to Wendy's.",Phoebe Buffay,8,15,9,16
"No, no, no, no! He's fine! Look, look, look! Here's your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!",Joey Tribbiani,8,15,9,17
"Well, I'm, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?",Ross Geller,8,15,10,2
"Oh, I've got big Valentine's plans! I've got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!",Rachel Green,8,15,10,3
"Y'know, it's interesting! Most people think that's made with seawater, when in fact-",Ross Geller,8,15,10,4
"Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.",Rachel Green,8,15,10,5
Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash!,Rachel Green,8,15,10,7
"Mona? What are-hi! What are you doing here? I'm, um, supposed to pick you up!",Ross Geller,8,15,10,8
Ayyyayyyy!,Ross Geller,8,15,10,10
"Oh, hey, Mona!",Rachel Green,8,15,10,11
I have no idea!,Ross Geller,8,15,10,13
I'll be watching TV if anybody needs me.,Rachel Green,8,15,10,14
"Uh...lately, she just likes hanging out here.",Ross Geller,8,15,10,16
I think she's lonely.,Ross Geller,8,15,10,18
I know.,Ross Geller,8,15,10,20
"No, no. She's way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.",Ross Geller,8,15,10,22
I'm not here! That's just my Chinese food!,Rachel Green,8,15,10,24
"Mm-hmm. She's-she's emotional, but, but ballsy.",Ross Geller,8,15,10,26
"You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed!",Rachel Green,8,15,10,27
"And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don't you, uh, open the champagne, and I'll be right back. I've got a surprise for you.",Ross Geller,8,15,10,28
Please start drinking!,Ross Geller,8,15,10,30
I'm just going to grab the phone.,Rachel Green,8,15,10,31
"Oh, I'm sorry! Do you need the phone?",Rachel Green,8,15,10,33
"But, but, Mona, I live here.",Rachel Green,8,15,10,35
Happy Valentine's Day! ...Or something to remember me by.,Ross Geller,8,15,10,36
How long has it been this time?,Monica Geller,8,15,11,2
90 seconds.,Chandler Bing,8,15,11,3
That's better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it...except all I did was think about it.,Monica Geller,8,15,11,4
"You know, it haunts me? Up 'til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!",Chandler Bing,8,15,11,5
"Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don't we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?",Monica Geller,8,15,11,6
I can do that.,Chandler Bing,8,15,11,7
Okay.,Monica Geller,8,15,11,8
Okay. Now all we've got to do is get rid of this chair.,Chandler Bing,8,15,11,10
"Oh, thank God!",Monica Geller,8,15,11,12
"Oh, I know!",Chandler Bing,8,15,11,13
Come in!,Monica Geller,8,15,11,14
"Hi! I'm so sorry to barge in on your Valentine's, but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.",Rachel Green,8,15,11,15
"Oh, my God.",Monica Geller,8,15,11,16
Poor Ross.,Chandler Bing,8,15,11,17
"Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!",Chandler Bing,8,15,11,19
"Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It's here.",Monica Geller,8,15,11,20
"Oh, And We Should Warn You, Before You Watch It don't watch it.",Chandler Bing,8,15,11,21
Why? You saw it? Is it scary?,Rachel Green,8,15,11,22
"Well, let's just say it's ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.",Chandler Bing,8,15,11,23
"Well, now, wait. Now I'm all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.",Rachel Green,8,15,11,24
"No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!",Monica Geller,8,15,11,25
"C'mon, seriously, you guys, you're not going to make me watch this alone!",Rachel Green,8,15,11,26
"She's right...of course not. Honey, get the tape.",Monica Geller,8,15,11,27
"This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. Okay, here we go.",Chandler Bing,8,15,11,28
"Okay. Ooh, my! Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!",Rachel Green,8,15,11,29
Why have I seen this thing three times?!,Chandler Bing,8,15,11,30
It's...still beautiful.,Monica Geller,8,15,11,31
Uh! It's horrible!,Rachel Green,8,15,11,32
"I know! I know, I'm so sorry for you!",Monica Geller,8,15,11,33
"Oh, my God!",Rachel Green,8,15,11,34
"Wait, you guys, look!",Chandler Bing,8,15,11,36
What? Did her ass explode?!,Rachel Green,8,15,11,37
"No, the baby's out! Look, look!",Chandler Bing,8,15,11,38
"Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!",Monica Geller,8,15,11,39
And look how happy the mom is now!,Chandler Bing,8,15,11,40
Oh...Rach!,Monica Geller,8,15,11,41
"Oh, screw you guys, you don't have to do it!",Rachel Green,8,15,11,42
"Hey, hey, man!",Ross Geller,8,15,12,2
"Hey, what's up?",Joey Tribbiani,8,15,12,3
Uh...Mona just dumped me.,Ross Geller,8,15,12,4
"Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?",Joey Tribbiani,8,15,12,5
"Well, with everything that's been going on lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?",Ross Geller,8,15,12,6
"Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine's Day.",Joey Tribbiani,8,15,12,7
"Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine's Day? What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?",Ross Geller,8,15,12,8
Sort of.,Joey Tribbiani,8,15,12,9
Really?!,Ross Geller,8,15,12,10
You don't have to seem so happy about it.,Joey Tribbiani,8,15,12,11
"Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.",Ross Geller,8,15,12,12
"Oh, I...I d-",Joey Tribbiani,8,15,12,13
"Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y'know, actually once-once I got dumped during sex.",Ross Geller,8,15,12,14
"Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?",Ross Geller,8,15,12,16
Forget about it. It's no big deal.,Joey Tribbiani,8,15,12,17
C'mon! Joey! What is it?,Ross Geller,8,15,12,18
It's nothing.,Joey Tribbiani,8,15,12,19
"Hey, hey, it's me. Why can't you tell me?",Ross Geller,8,15,12,20
"Okay, uh...sit down. Um... there's this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh...it can't happen.",Joey Tribbiani,8,15,12,21
She's not a Tribbiani?,Ross Geller,8,15,12,22
No!,Joey Tribbiani,8,15,12,23
"I knew it. So, is she someone from work?",Ross Geller,8,15,12,24
Yes.,Joey Tribbiani,8,15,12,25
"Well, uh, does she like you?",Ross Geller,8,15,12,26
"Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn't matter, because I can't do anything about it.",Joey Tribbiani,8,15,12,27
Why not?,Ross Geller,8,15,12,28
"Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we're really good friends.",Joey Tribbiani,8,15,12,29
"So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh... is he still in love with her?",Ross Geller,8,15,12,30
No. I don't think so.,Joey Tribbiani,8,15,12,31
Okay. Um... is he a good guy?,Ross Geller,8,15,12,32
"Yeah, he's the best.",Joey Tribbiani,8,15,12,33
Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.,Ross Geller,8,15,12,34
"Oh, I don't know.",Joey Tribbiani,8,15,12,35
"Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.",Ross Geller,8,15,12,36
"I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-",Joey Tribbiani,8,15,12,37
"Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.",Ross Geller,8,15,12,38
"I'm going to...uh...I'm going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.",Ross Geller,8,15,12,40
"Oh, yeah.",Joey Tribbiani,8,15,12,41
"Anyway... seriously, uh...just...just talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes.",Ross Geller,8,15,12,42
It's Rachel.,Joey Tribbiani,8,15,12,43
"You're going to have a baby, and you need to be prepared. Now, you're going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it!",Rachel Green,8,15,13,2
Hmm...maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.,Rachel Green,8,15,13,6
"There's this woman, that I like. A lot. Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. And I could never do that to the guy, y'know? 'Ccause we're really good friends.",Joey Tribbiani,8,16,1,2
"So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh... is he a good guy?",Ross Geller,8,16,1,3
"Yeah, he's the best.",Joey Tribbiani,8,16,1,4
Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.,Ross Geller,8,16,1,5
"Oh, I don't know.",Joey Tribbiani,8,16,1,6
"Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.",Ross Geller,8,16,1,7
"I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-",Joey Tribbiani,8,16,1,8
"Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.",Ross Geller,8,16,1,9
It's Rachel.,Joey Tribbiani,8,16,1,10
"Did you um-I'm sorry, did you just say it's Rachel?",Ross Geller,8,16,1,12
Yes.,Joey Tribbiani,8,16,1,13
"Um, you...you like Rachel?",Ross Geller,8,16,1,14
Yes. I like Rachel.,Joey Tribbiani,8,16,1,15
Rachel?!,Ross Geller,8,16,1,16
"Yeah, okay but look, buy uh-Hey-hey, y'know, y'know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn't get said enough. I like you Ross.",Joey Tribbiani,8,16,1,17
But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!,Ross Geller,8,16,1,18
"Yeah, but it's not a big deal.",Joey Tribbiani,8,16,1,19
"It's not a big deal? Oh, I'm sorry I just...um, I...what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like-you-you can't stop thinking about her. Like how you can't sleep?",Ross Geller,8,16,1,20
"I'm an actor, y'know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.",Joey Tribbiani,8,16,1,21
Rachel who's carrying my baby? Rachel?,Ross Geller,8,16,1,22
"Look no, I-I know it's bad, and I know it's wrong. Okay? But-but it's not like anything's ever gonna happen. Y'know? These-these are just feelings, they're gonna go away.",Joey Tribbiani,8,16,1,23
Y'know what? I-I gotta go.,Ross Geller,8,16,1,24
Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don't...,Joey Tribbiani,8,16,1,25
I just-y'know-I-I just have one-Rachel?!,Ross Geller,8,16,1,26
"Oh-oh! Okay, she's kicking!",Rachel Green,8,16,2,2
Oh! She's growing inside you.,Chandler Bing,8,16,2,3
Whoa!!,Rachel Green,8,16,2,4
Oh!,Chandler Bing,8,16,2,5
Wow that was a big one.,Rachel Green,8,16,2,6
I think that's the youngest girl ever to reject me.,Chandler Bing,8,16,2,7
Oh hey you guys!,Phoebe Buffay,8,16,2,8
Oh hey!,Chandler Bing,8,16,2,9
Hi!,Rachel Green,8,16,2,10
"Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?",Phoebe Buffay,8,16,2,11
Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That's why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He'll find me.,Rachel Green,8,16,2,12
"Uh-huh, and you?",Phoebe Buffay,8,16,2,13
"No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don't think they exist.",Chandler Bing,8,16,2,14
"Okay, good.",Phoebe Buffay,8,16,2,15
Why?,Chandler Bing,8,16,2,16
"Well last night, I met Monica's.",Phoebe Buffay,8,16,2,17
What?,Chandler Bing,8,16,2,18
"Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.",Phoebe Buffay,8,16,2,19
"Come on, don't be crazy. You don't think there's someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya?",Chandler Bing,8,16,2,20
"Well, what's he like?!",Rachel Green,8,16,2,21
Well he's tall.,Phoebe Buffay,8,16,2,22
Uh-huh.,Rachel Green,8,16,2,23
He has brown hair.,Phoebe Buffay,8,16,2,24
"Of course, of course.",Rachel Green,8,16,2,25
"A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!",Chandler Bing,8,16,2,26
He works with food!,Phoebe Buffay,8,16,2,27
Oh sure. Older?,Rachel Green,8,16,2,28
"Obviously, and he's British.",Phoebe Buffay,8,16,2,29
"Oh, I was just gonna ask!",Rachel Green,8,16,2,30
"Yeah? And, he's-he's so centered and mature and confident.",Phoebe Buffay,8,16,2,31
"Oh, it's so sad they never had a chance to meet.",Rachel Green,8,16,2,32
"Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about.",Chandler Bing,8,16,2,33
"Oh, I'm so sorry. Um, and maybe I'm wrong! I but-y'know I'm gonna go out with him again, I'll find out more.",Phoebe Buffay,8,16,2,34
You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you're still gonna date him?,Chandler Bing,8,16,2,35
"Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat.",Phoebe Buffay,8,16,2,36
Hey.,Monica Geller,8,16,3,2
Hey.,Ross Geller,8,16,3,3
"I just talked to Joey, I just-I want to see how you were.",Monica Geller,8,16,3,4
"Oh y'know, I still-I can't believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it's... It's like you and me going out, only weirder!",Ross Geller,8,16,3,5
"All right, I know you're hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don't say that again.",Monica Geller,8,16,3,6
"Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he'd be the stepfather of my child.",Ross Geller,8,16,3,7
"Honey, I don't think that's something we need to worry about! First of all he's-he's never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she'd react.",Monica Geller,8,16,3,8
"Sure, because women never like Joey. Y'know, I think he's a virgin.",Ross Geller,8,16,3,9
Joey...he's not even thinking about going after Rachel!,Monica Geller,8,16,3,10
He's not?,Ross Geller,8,16,3,11
"No! All he's thinking about is how you're taking this! I mean, listen it's totally freaking him out. He's talking about moving to Vermont.",Monica Geller,8,16,3,12
Why?,Ross Geller,8,16,3,13
He says he wants to leave the country. He thinks you hate him.,Monica Geller,8,16,3,14
"Hate him? I... No, I don't hate him. It's just it's Rachel, y'know?",Ross Geller,8,16,3,15
"Honey I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don't want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you're still his friend.",Monica Geller,8,16,3,16
"Okay. Okay, I'll talk to him.",Ross Geller,8,16,3,17
"All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.",Monica Geller,8,16,3,18
Oh! Hi!,Phoebe Buffay,8,16,4,2
Hi!,Monica Geller,8,16,4,3
"Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.",Phoebe Buffay,8,16,4,4
Soul mate.,Phoebe Buffay,8,16,4,6

"All right, what's going on?",Monica Geller,8,16,8,8
"Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don't believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won't stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.",Chandler Bing,8,16,8,9
"Chandler, you don't believe in soul mates?",Monica Geller,8,16,8,10

I don't believe in soul mates either.,Monica Geller,8,16,8,12
You don't?,Chandler Bing,8,16,8,13

So you...you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house?,Chandler Bing,8,16,8,15

"Joey, you have to talk to her!",Monica Geller,8,17,1,5

I can't! Y'know? You guys don't know what it's like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.,Joey Tribbiani,8,17,1,24
"I don't know what that's like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, ""I love you,"" was, ""Oh crap!""",Chandler Bing,8,17,1,25
"Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry.",Monica Geller,8,17,1,26
"All right so, so what do I do?",Joey Tribbiani,8,17,1,27

I didn't know you read tea leaves.,Chandler Bing,8,17,2,3
"Oh yeah, I've done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y'know, and-and y'know, one of the great joys of life is it's-it's wondrous unpredictability. Y'know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.",Phoebe Buffay,8,17,2,4
"Okay, I'm done. Read mine.",Monica Geller,8,17,2,5
"Okay. Ooh, I see a ladder. Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.",Phoebe Buffay,8,17,2,6

What does yours say Pheebs?,Chandler Bing,8,17,2,14

Well just ask Mona to give it back!,Rachel Green,8,17,2,23
"I don't know. I mean I-I guess I could. It's just that we didn't really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I'd be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die.",Ross Geller,8,17,2,24
"Oh wait a second you guys...for the last couple weeks I've been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he's the tea guy.",Phoebe Buffay,8,17,2,25

"I know it's tough now, but things will get better.",Chandler Bing,8,17,3,3
"How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can't even be in the same room with each other?!",Rachel Green,8,17,3,4

Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!,Rachel Green,8,17,3,15

I can't believe that you yelled at my boss! I'm-I'm gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!,Rachel Green,8,17,9,17
You can always sell your baby.,Chandler Bing,8,17,9,18

What?!,Monica Geller,8,17,12,5
A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that's what they gave me? When I get up there I'm going to kick some ass.,Phoebe Buffay,8,17,12,6
"Don't worry Phoebe, you're gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.",Monica Geller,8,17,12,7
"Yeah, we both can. And we both will.",Phoebe Buffay,8,17,12,8

Hi.,Rachel Green,8,17,13,2
So? What-what-what happened?,Joey Tribbiani,8,17,13,3
It's all gonna be okay. They're just so happy that I'm not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.,Rachel Green,8,17,13,4
"Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they're not in the baby buying business.",Chandler Bing,8,17,13,5

"Hey you're right. Yeah, it's kinda been like us again a little bit.",Joey Tribbiani,8,17,13,13
Yeah I know! I miss that.,Rachel Green,8,17,13,14
Me too. I mean I...haven't thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn't feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.,Joey Tribbiani,8,17,13,15
My gynecologist tried to kill me.,Rachel Green,8,17,13,17

"Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? Who said that?",Chandler Bing,8,18,1,7
"Yeah, he's really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.",Phoebe Buffay,8,18,1,8
"Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?",Monica Geller,8,18,1,9
"Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?",Ross Geller,8,18,1,10
"Yeah, I'd really like to.",Monica Geller,8,18,1,11
"Okay, hopefully this time mom won't boo you.",Ross Geller,8,18,1,12
"Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it's always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I'm going to make them cry.",Monica Geller,8,18,1,13
And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?,Chandler Bing,8,18,1,14
"No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, ""God, your brother."" Know what they'll say this year? ""God, you""",Monica Geller,8,18,1,15
"Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. I'm an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue.",Joey Tribbiani,8,18,1,16
Really you can do that?,Monica Geller,8,18,1,17
Are you kidding me? Watch! Well I can't do it with you guys watching me!,Joey Tribbiani,8,18,1,18

And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.,Joey Tribbiani,8,18,2,15
"Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?",Rachel Green,8,18,2,16
"Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt, and I think my testacles may be in here too.",Chandler Bing,8,18,2,17
"Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog! Y'know Monica couldn't get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.",Ross Geller,8,18,2,18
What?!,Monica Geller,8,18,2,19
You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!,Ross Geller,8,18,2,20
Hey!,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,2,22
"Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is...",Phoebe Buffay,8,18,2,24

"Ah, actually, I'm sorry we-we probably should get going.",Ross Geller,8,18,2,28
"I, uh, think you already are.",Rachel Green,8,18,2,30

Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?,Ross Geller,8,18,2,46
"Yeah, otherwise I'm not going.",Rachel Green,8,18,2,47
Hi! Hey mom.,Ross Geller,8,18,3,3
"This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?",Rachel Green,8,18,3,4
"That's a good question, dad. That's a good question...",Ross Geller,8,18,3,7
Hmmm....,Rachel Green,8,18,3,8
Thank you...we're so excited!,Rachel Green,8,18,3,10
Wha-What?,Ross Geller,8,18,3,12
Dad so what we have to pretend that we're married?,Ross Geller,8,18,3,16
Can you believe that?,Ross Geller,8,18,3,18
"Yeah, if you're going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.",Rachel Green,8,18,3,19
"No, us having to lie about being married.",Ross Geller,8,18,3,20
"No, I know I don't either, but ya know what, it's their party, and it's just one night. And we don't even have to lie; we just won't say anything. If it comes up again, we'll just...smile. We'll nod along.",Rachel Green,8,18,3,21
"Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan.",Ross Geller,8,18,3,24
Oh...,Rachel Green,8,18,3,28
Unbelievable!,Rachel Green,8,18,3,30
We love marriage!,Ross Geller,8,18,3,31
Hey.,Ross Geller,8,18,3,34
Hey!,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,3,35
I don't think the flash went off.,Chandler Bing,8,18,3,37
I'll go with you,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,3,39
Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.,Chandler Bing,8,18,3,41
"I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don't want him complimenting my thing.",Joey Tribbiani,8,18,3,42
I'm so we weren't in the car! Did he ever let up?,Ross Geller,8,18,3,43
He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.,Monica Geller,8,18,3,44
This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture! Ooh sorry...,Ross Geller,8,18,3,45
Were you guys making fun of Parker?,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,3,46
"That depends, how much did you hear?",Ross Geller,8,18,3,47
"So, he a little enthusiastic, what's wrong with that?",Phoebe Buffay,8,18,3,48
"It's just that, it's so much.",Monica Geller,8,18,3,49
"Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you've dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don't do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? 'Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who's who of human crap.",Phoebe Buffay,8,18,3,50
I feel terrible.,Monica Geller,8,18,3,51
I know.,Joey Tribbiani,8,18,3,52
What was wrong with Mona?,Ross Geller,8,18,3,53
Open it! Open it! Open it!,Rachel Green,8,18,4,2
Yeah baby!,Ross Geller,8,18,4,3
"No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.",Ross Geller,8,18,4,6
"But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.",Rachel Green,8,18,4,7
"On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isn't She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.",Rachel Green,8,18,4,9
"Yeah, Stevie's an old family friend.",Rachel Green,8,18,4,11
So would I. You wouldn't think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.,Rachel Green,8,18,4,13
Would you excuse us for a second? Umm.... what are you doing?,Ross Geller,8,18,4,14
What? I'm not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.,Rachel Green,8,18,4,15
"Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.",Ross Geller,8,18,4,16
"Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.",Rachel Green,8,18,4,17
"No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you.",Phoebe Buffay,8,18,4,20
"Hm huh, yeah.",Phoebe Buffay,8,18,4,22
"No, that's not necessary.",Phoebe Buffay,8,18,4,24
"No, actually I don't eat...",Phoebe Buffay,8,18,4,26
"Okay, fine! Fine! Mmm...hmmmmm....",Phoebe Buffay,8,18,4,28
Why don't you just try one?,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,4,30
What are you doin'?,Chandler Bing,8,18,4,33
Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit 'em. I can't wait. They're going to be crying so hard. They're going to be fighting for breath.,Monica Geller,8,18,4,34
"Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could .",Chandler Bing,8,18,4,35
"And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.",Rachel Green,8,18,4,37
"Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.",Rachel Green,8,18,4,39
"Well, I don't know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.",Rachel Green,8,18,4,41
Oh yeah. That's a great story.,Rachel Green,8,18,4,43
"Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. That's-that's where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower...",Ross Geller,8,18,4,44
Shhh! I want to hear the rest!,Rachel Green,8,18,4,46
"Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words ""Will you marry me?""",Ross Geller,8,18,4,47
"And the ring, was the size of my fist !",Rachel Green,8,18,4,49
"Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker's a nice guy and I'd like to get to know him.",Joey Tribbiani,8,18,4,51
Then you better do it now.,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,4,52
Why?,Joey Tribbiani,8,18,4,53
Because I'm going to kill him,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,4,54
What-what?,Joey Tribbiani,8,18,4,55
"You guys were right. He's just too excited about...everything. I mean I'm all for living life, but this is the Geller's 35th anniversary. Okay? Let's call a spade a spade this party stinks.",Phoebe Buffay,8,18,4,56
"I know I'm having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!",Joey Tribbiani,8,18,4,57
Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,4,58
"I guess it could've been, I didn't really look at it. Y'know, I just wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out of there.",Joey Tribbiani,8,18,4,59
He's just such a great guy I'm so excited about him.,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,4,60
"Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There's nothing wrong with him he's a good guy.",Joey Tribbiani,8,18,4,61
You think?,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,4,62
Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.,Joey Tribbiani,8,18,4,63
"You're right. You're right, he's just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I'm a sunny, positive person.",Phoebe Buffay,8,18,4,64
"Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.",Joey Tribbiani,8,18,4,65
What's that now?,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,4,66
Nothing...,Joey Tribbiani,8,18,4,67
Oh look it's Parker!,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,4,68
Oooh I love it!,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,4,70
Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,4,72
"Okay it's time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I'm going to do it.",Monica Geller,8,18,4,74
"No, no it's going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don't say it enough, but I love you. When I look around this room, I'm-I'm saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can't because she's dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. . Was. Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she's dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment? Didn't see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. You people are made of stone! Here's to mom and dad! Whatever!",Monica Geller,8,18,4,76
"Oh, no, Mom, it's just Monica this year.",Ross Geller,8,18,4,80
"No, of course, Um... Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say...on behalf of my new bride, Rachel , and myself. Umm, that if...if in 35 years, we're half as happy as you guys are, we'll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.",Ross Geller,8,18,4,82
Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,5,3
Oh thank God.,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,5,5
"Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don't we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!",Phoebe Buffay,8,18,5,7
"Let's try something else, let's play a game.",Phoebe Buffay,8,18,5,9
Shocking! Let's play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,5,11
"But, let's play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!",Phoebe Buffay,8,18,5,13
Oh my God! Oh my God!,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,5,16
"Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn't perfect? Everything isn't magical? Everything isn't a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!",Phoebe Buffay,8,18,5,18
You don't have to put a good spin on everything.,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,5,20
"No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!",Phoebe Buffay,8,18,5,22
Much less happy!,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,5,24
So long! Don't let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out!,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,5,26
Uh huh.,Phoebe Buffay,8,18,5,29
"...and then, we could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!",Ross Geller,8,18,6,2
"Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.",Rachel Green,8,18,6,3
But having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem?,Ross Geller,8,18,6,4
It was really fun being married to you tonight.,Rachel Green,8,18,6,5
"Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I've ever made.",Ross Geller,8,18,6,6
"Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?",Rachel Green,8,18,6,7
Yeah.,Ross Geller,8,18,6,8
"That proposal, at the planetarium...",Rachel Green,8,18,6,9
"I know, I know it was stupid.",Ross Geller,8,18,6,10
"Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was...really wonderful! Did you just make that up?",Rachel Green,8,18,6,11
"No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.",Ross Geller,8,18,6,12
"Well, that would've been very hard to say no too.",Rachel Green,8,18,6,13
"It's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding. Okay, good night.",Ross Geller,8,18,6,14
Goodnight.,Rachel Green,8,18,6,15
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up?,Ross Geller,8,18,6,17
I will think about it.,Rachel Green,8,18,6,18
That's all I'm askin'.,Ross Geller,8,18,6,19
"Okay that's it. I give up. At mom and dad's 40th anniversary, you're the one giving the speech.",Monica Geller,8,18,7,2
Y'know I don't understand why they didn't cry. It was a beautiful speech.,Ross Geller,8,18,7,3
"Oh, come on.",Monica Geller,8,18,7,4
"Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would've wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.",Ross Geller,8,18,7,5
"Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?",Monica Geller,8,18,7,6
Hi!,Rachel Green,8,19,1,2
Hey!,Ross Geller,8,19,1,3
Hey!,Monica Geller,8,19,1,4
"So, I'm in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down.",Rachel Green,8,19,1,5
"Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That's me!! I'm blank!!",Joey Tribbiani,8,19,1,6
How cool is this?! We know three down! I'm touching three down!,Monica Geller,8,19,1,7
Yeah you are baby.,Joey Tribbiani,8,19,1,8
"Three down knows I'm married, what's three down doin'?",Monica Geller,8,19,1,9
So did they call you to tell you your name's gonna be in this?,Rachel Green,8,19,1,10
"No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.",Joey Tribbiani,8,19,1,11
Why'd you say no?,Ross Geller,8,19,1,12
"Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.",Joey Tribbiani,8,19,1,13
If only there was something in your head to control the things you say.,Chandler Bing,8,19,1,14
"Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y'know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don't know, gal pal Rachel Green?",Rachel Green,8,19,1,15
Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?,Chandler Bing,8,19,1,16
"Okay, don't listen to him. Please?",Rachel Green,8,19,1,17
"Fine! All right, I'll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y'know, start to say something stupid.",Joey Tribbiani,8,19,1,18
"Just then or-or all the time, 'cause we-we have jobs y'know.",Ross Geller,8,19,1,19
"Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green. Ha-ha! I'm gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. Seriously, proud of you.",Rachel Green,8,19,1,20
Yeah.,Joey Tribbiani,8,19,1,21
"Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.",Joey Tribbiani,8,19,2,3
You think we're being obvious?,Monica Geller,8,19,2,5
"No, we're just four people with neck problems. You talk like this.",Chandler Bing,8,19,2,6
"Actually, I didn't know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn't have mattered, I'm doing this for the fans, not for the free food.",Joey Tribbiani,8,19,2,9
And I'll have all the muffins.,Joey Tribbiani,8,19,2,12
Hey!,Phoebe Buffay,8,19,2,14
Shhh! We're not talking.,Ross Geller,8,19,2,15
Oh. Finally! Oh.,Phoebe Buffay,8,19,2,16
"All you want is a dingle/What you envy's a schwang/A thing through which you can tinkle/Or play with, or simply let hang...",Joey Tribbiani,8,19,2,20
"Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!",Joey Tribbiani,8,19,2,23

"The doctor says it's completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, you-you're sleep deprived.",Ross Geller,8,24,12,17
So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don't see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God.,Rachel Green,8,24,12,18
What's the matter now?,Joey Tribbiani,8,24,12,19

"Oh, wait a minute it's not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!",Phoebe Buffay,8,24,12,23
"Uh actually, we-we've narrowed it down to two names.",Ross Geller,8,24,12,24

"That's not her name! I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.",Rachel Green,8,24,12,27

"And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.",Chandler Bing,8,24,13,4
Ohhh! Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn't he?,Rachel Green,8,24,14,3
"Oh, I'm fine.",Rachel Green,8,24,14,5
"Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.",Rachel Green,8,24,14,7
"Well then he gets a divorce, it's Ross!",Rachel Green,8,24,14,9
Well I-That's never gonna happen with Ross.,Rachel Green,8,24,14,11
Really?,Rachel Green,8,24,14,13
"Well... That's...y'know-That's-We've been alone for the last twenty minutes we're doing okay. Besides y'know what? I-I-Maybe we won't be alone, 'cause lately I-I-things have been happening between me and Ross, y'know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Y'know? So it might be the...the beginning of something.",Rachel Green,8,24,14,15
Hey Janice!,Ross Geller,8,24,14,16
Who's this little guy?,Ross Geller,8,24,14,18
No-no. No.,Ross Geller,8,24,14,20

"Uh-huh. Y'know what I was, I was thinking about?",Rachel Green,8,24,14,25

Umm...that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?,Rachel Green,8,24,14,27
"Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we...we gotta be careful. We...we can't let that happen again, y'know?",Ross Geller,8,24,14,28
Right.,Rachel Green,8,24,14,29
I mean we don't want to go down that road do we?,Ross Geller,8,24,14,30
"No! No, of course not. No. That's why I brought it up. They didn't have any sodas?",Rachel Green,8,24,14,31
"Oh my God! I'm sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.",Ross Geller,8,24,14,32
That's all right. And so it begins.,Rachel Green,8,24,14,33
Is she in there?,Phoebe Buffay,8,24,15,2
"Yeah. She's putting her down now, that's her.",Ross Geller,8,24,15,3
Oh!,Phoebe Buffay,8,24,15,4

"I just can't decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?",Phoebe Buffay,8,24,15,6
"Oh what are you kidding? She's gorgeous, it's all Rachel.",Ross Geller,8,24,15,7
"I'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again? No, I know. I know, because you're not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.",Phoebe Buffay,8,24,15,9
It's...it's complicated okay?,Ross Geller,8,24,15,10
"Yeah that's true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.",Phoebe Buffay,8,24,15,11
"Look, we've been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby. It's just if-if we got together again and it didn't work out...I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything- Oh that's...now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we're doing really, we're doing really well right now.",Ross Geller,8,24,15,12
"I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.",Phoebe Buffay,8,24,15,13
"Yeah, exactly.",Ross Geller,8,24,15,14
Right. Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were fifteen.,Phoebe Buffay,8,24,15,15
Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here. What's the matter?,Joey Tribbiani,8,24,16,2

"Yeah, I guess so.",Joey Tribbiani,8,24,16,12
I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?,Rachel Green,8,24,16,13
"Hey, listen to me, listen to me...you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise that's not gonna happen.",Joey Tribbiani,8,24,16,14

"Yay! It's so exciting! Wow, you could've done that with us there.",Phoebe Buffay,9,1,2,7
Yeah right.,Ross Geller,9,1,2,8
"Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can't talk to Rachel.",Phoebe Buffay,9,1,2,9
What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?,Ross Geller,9,1,2,10
"Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.",Phoebe Buffay,9,1,2,11
"Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?",Joey Tribbiani,9,1,2,12

"No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!",Joey Tribbiani,9,1,2,16
What?! Why does she think that?,Chandler Bing,9,1,2,17
Because it kinda looked like I did.,Joey Tribbiani,9,1,2,18
"Again, what?!",Chandler Bing,9,1,2,19
"Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand.",Joey Tribbiani,9,1,2,20
As we all are at some point during the day.,Chandler Bing,9,1,2,21
It wasn't my ring! It fell out of Ross's jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!,Joey Tribbiani,9,1,2,22

Well maybe you don't have to tell him anything.,Chandler Bing,9,1,2,31
"Oh, I like that. Yeah.",Joey Tribbiani,9,1,2,32
"If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!",Chandler Bing,9,1,2,33

Oh my God! He did it?,Phoebe Buffay,9,1,3,5
Well...did you know he was gonna ask me?,Rachel Green,9,1,3,6

And you really think this is a good idea?,Rachel Green,9,1,3,8
"I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.",Phoebe Buffay,9,1,3,9
I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.,Rachel Green,9,1,3,10
"Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.",Phoebe Buffay,9,1,3,11

I can't say that I'm surprised.,Rachel Green,9,1,3,19
"Dad, what are you doing?",Ross Geller,9,1,4,1
"It can't be me, I'm standing right here.",Joey Tribbiani,9,1,4,3

Y'know what? I don't like you without mom. Come on.,Ross Geller,9,1,4,7
We're not peeking?,Joey Tribbiani,9,1,4,8
"Hello sir, you know Monica.",Chandler Bing,9,1,4,10

"Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.",Rachel Green,9,1,5,9
Dear Lord.,Joey Tribbiani,9,1,5,10
"I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?",Rachel Green,9,1,5,11
"Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that.",Joey Tribbiani,9,1,5,12
"Oh look, she's pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? She looks scared. Doesn't she look scared?",Rachel Green,9,1,5,13
"Y'know, I don't really know her.",Joey Tribbiani,9,1,5,14
Are you kidding me?!,Joey Tribbiani,9,1,5,16
It's just so frustrating! Why doesn't she want my breast?!,Rachel Green,9,1,5,17
I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!,Joey Tribbiani,9,1,5,18
Oh hey! Wait up!,Phoebe Buffay,9,1,6,1

"No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!",Phoebe Buffay,9,1,6,5

"Oh, it's a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time.",Phoebe Buffay,9,1,6,7
"Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn't propose.",Ross Geller,9,1,6,8
Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?,Phoebe Buffay,9,1,6,9
I am a doctor! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.,Ross Geller,9,1,6,10
"All right, me too. Should we wake her up?",Phoebe Buffay,9,1,6,11
"No! No, come on let her sleep! She's so exhausted.",Ross Geller,9,1,6,12
And so engaged.,Phoebe Buffay,9,1,6,13
What? Oh my God! She-she thinks we're engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we're engaged?!,Ross Geller,9,1,6,14
Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y'know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.,Phoebe Buffay,9,1,6,15
I didn't give her that ring!,Ross Geller,9,1,6,16
Really?,Phoebe Buffay,9,1,6,17

"Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.",Rachel Green,9,3,6,8

"No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.",Chandler Bing,9,3,9,9
'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.,Monica Geller,9,3,9,10
'So Cheesy' also has an opening.,Chandler Bing,9,3,9,11

"You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.",Phoebe Buffay,9,3,11,1
"Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.",Joey Tribbiani,9,3,11,2

Do you not know each other?,Phoebe Buffay,9,3,11,11

Who are you kidding? You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!,Phoebe Buffay,9,3,11,21
"Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one. Mike!! Mike!!",Joey Tribbiani,9,3,11,22

"I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.",Monica Geller,9,3,12,8
What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?,Chandler Bing,9,3,12,9
"Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.",Monica Geller,9,3,12,10
I think you should take the job.,Chandler Bing,9,3,12,11
Really?,Monica Geller,9,3,12,12

Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?,Chandler Bing,9,3,12,22
"Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.",Rachel Green,9,3,12,23
"Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'",Ross Geller,9,3,12,24
Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?,Chandler Bing,9,3,12,25
"Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!",Ross Geller,9,3,12,26
That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!,Chandler Bing,9,3,12,27
It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!,Ross Geller,9,3,12,28

Look at this. My two best friends!,Joey Tribbiani,9,3,13,22
"Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me.",Ross Geller,9,3,14,1
With the circus? He's behind the elephant.,Ross Geller,9,3,14,4
"Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.",Ross Geller,9,3,14,6

"No, you're right. Mnya, we shouldn't do it like this. Huch. For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.",Monica Geller,9,5,9,5

You know what? Let's not talk.,Monica Geller,9,5,11,2

"Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough.",Monica Geller,9,5,12,59
You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.,Chandler Bing,9,5,12,60

"Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.",Rachel Green,9,6,10,16

"So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is...",Joey Tribbiani,9,6,12,18
Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?,Ross Geller,9,6,12,19
...No...,Joey Tribbiani,9,6,12,20
I can't believe he's that upset about this...,Monica Geller,9,6,12,21
"Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like...",Joey Tribbiani,9,6,12,22
Hey!,Chandler Bing,9,6,12,23

I swear to God...!,Ross Geller,9,6,14,4
Me! I'm up for puppets!,Joey Tribbiani,9,6,14,6
"Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?",Ross Geller,9,6,14,8
I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch.,Joey Tribbiani,9,6,14,10

"Real estate, huh? Hmmm...",Joey Tribbiani,9,7,2,12

They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!,Phoebe Buffay,9,7,3,7
"Oh yeah, she can't be herself.",Rachel Green,9,7,3,8
"Okay, so... allright... Which dress? You can say ""neither"".",Phoebe Buffay,9,7,3,9
"I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be fine.",Monica Geller,9,7,3,11
"Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like: ""Oh mr. Pincer, I can see where Wallis gets his good looks...""",Rachel Green,9,7,3,12

You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?,Rachel Green,9,7,4,5
"Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. It was... it was like uhm... Only... only not creepy.",Ross Geller,9,7,4,6
"Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh?",Rachel Green,9,7,4,7
"I uhm... Well, I sang... well actually I rapped... Baby Got Back...",Ross Geller,9,7,4,8
You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?,Rachel Green,9,7,4,9
"But you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles.",Ross Geller,9,7,4,10

"Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you?",Joey Tribbiani,9,7,5,10
"We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man! You don't think he's here, do you?",Chandler Bing,9,7,5,11
"You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see... Yeah, I could see it.",Joey Tribbiani,9,7,5,12
"Look at these videos. You know, I mean, who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God!",Chandler Bing,9,7,5,13

There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.,Chandler Bing,9,7,5,15

Got it! It... It's hard to stop...,Phoebe Buffay,9,7,6,18
"Uhm... Okay, well, allright, uhm... Originally I'm from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went to prison, so... I just moved to the city where uhm... I actually lived in a burned out Buick LeSabre for a while... which was okay, that was okay, until uhm... I got hepatitis, you know, 'cause this pimp spit in my mouth and... but I... I got over it and uhm... anyway, now I'm uhm... a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't always steady money but at least I don't pay taxes, huh... So... where does everyone summer?",Phoebe Buffay,9,7,6,22
God! God! This is not going well.,Phoebe Buffay,9,7,7,1
"Okay, okay, okay, okay... Still sure about me being myself?",Phoebe Buffay,9,7,7,3

"Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised. Especially to you. Because he's very respectful of women.",Phoebe Buffay,9,7,7,26
Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.,Phoebe Buffay,9,7,7,28
"Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. No, he's not in like a sissy way. No, no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...",Phoebe Buffay,9,7,7,30

How did she get me to settle down?,Joey Tribbiani,9,7,8,10
"Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... Can it?",Chandler Bing,9,7,8,11
"Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya...",Joey Tribbiani,9,7,8,12
Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.,Chandler Bing,9,7,8,13
What? Whoo... What?,Joey Tribbiani,9,7,8,14
"Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?",Chandler Bing,9,7,8,15

"Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? Please laugh for mommy... Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'Cause mommy can rap... My name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are... Oh, I can't rap... Allright sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much, and I know that you're not gonna tell anybody... I like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh!

That tape was never meant to be seen by... Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.,Monica Geller,9,7,11,3
"Monica, look... I don't think you and I have any secrets anymore... Not ready to joke about it yet, okay, I see you later.",Joey Tribbiani,9,7,11,4
Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?,Monica Geller,9,7,11,5
"Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.",Chandler Bing,9,7,11,6
Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?,Monica Geller,9,7,11,7
This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.,Chandler Bing,9,7,11,8
"Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.",Monica Geller,9,7,11,9
"Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!",Chandler Bing,9,7,11,10
"Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all that matters.",Monica Geller,9,7,11,11
"Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...",Chandler Bing,9,7,11,12
Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life!,Monica Geller,9,7,11,13
"Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends.",Chandler Bing,9,7,11,14

Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!,Ross Geller,9,7,13,15
"Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?",Monica Geller,9,8,1,1
"Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?",Chandler Bing,9,8,1,2
"No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.",Monica Geller,9,8,1,3
"Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.",Chandler Bing,9,8,1,4
"What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.",Monica Geller,9,8,1,5
What is the point of having them if we never use them?,Chandler Bing,9,8,1,6
"Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..",Monica Geller,9,8,1,7

What are you going to do?,Chandler Bing,9,8,1,17
"I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said ""Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani."" Like.. like I was some kind of idiot.",Joey Tribbiani,9,8,1,18
Well you proved them wrong.,Chandler Bing,9,8,1,19

"Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said ""Hey don't eat that-that's Phoebe's"" and he said.. He said.. ""Joey you stink at lying."" What am I going to do?",Joey Tribbiani,9,8,1,65

Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.,Rachel Green,9,8,1,89
"You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.",Ross Geller,9,8,1,90
"Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond.",Rachel Green,9,8,1,91
"Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.",Ross Geller,9,8,1,92
"Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just going to have to make our peace with that! Monica and Chandler's apartment.",Rachel Green,9,8,1,93

"Pheebs, I still need some help here.",Joey Tribbiani,9,8,1,109
"Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying.",Phoebe Buffay,9,8,1,110
Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.,Joey Tribbiani,9,8,1,111
You are a terrific actor.,Phoebe Buffay,9,8,1,112
Oh we just put her down for a nap.,Rachel Green,9,8,1,114

"Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to Ross or to myself um you wouldn't get the baby.",Rachel Green,9,8,1,123
"Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.",Ross Geller,9,8,1,125
I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.,Chandler Bing,9,8,1,126
"yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.",Monica Geller,9,8,1,127
"See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.",Rachel Green,9,8,1,129
"You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two....",Chandler Bing,9,8,1,131
Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.,Monica Geller,9,8,1,133
Woah. Woah... Woah.,Ross Geller,9,8,1,134
"Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. Ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.",Monica Geller,9,8,1,135
Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?,Joey Tribbiani,9,8,1,136
"No, honey, its. thats a special plate. See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.",Monica Geller,9,8,1,137
I can't believe I won.,Joey Tribbiani,9,8,1,138
Monica is Ross' sister.,Rachel Green,9,8,1,140
That was me.,Monica Geller,9,8,1,142
"Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that. Monica about to have a heart attack: Okay, listen I know you're having a little bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I mean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this.",Rachel Green,9,8,1,144
"Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.",Monica Geller,9,8,1,145
"No, if crazy plate lad.. If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?",Chandler Bing,9,8,1,147
Well actually...,Rachel Green,9,8,1,148
Actually what?,Chandler Bing,9,8,1,149
"well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents.",Ross Geller,9,8,1,150
What?,Chandler Bing,9,8,1,151
Uh.. who has to die for me to get her? Commercial Break.,Joey Tribbiani,9,8,1,153
"So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?",Chandler Bing,9,8,1,154
"No, that that is not what we're saying.",Ross Geller,9,8,1,155
Yeah he's lying. He looked down.,Joey Tribbiani,9,8,1,156
Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!,Chandler Bing,9,8,1,157
"Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent.",Rachel Green,9,8,1,158
Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.,Ross Geller,9,8,1,159
"Thats not how you see me, is it? Phoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the air: No you're all about the fun.",Monica Geller,9,8,1,160
"Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?",Chandler Bing,9,8,1,161
"No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together.",Ross Geller,9,8,1,162
Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die she'd have to give her up.,Chandler Bing,9,8,1,163
"Sure, Monica would have to give her up.",Ross Geller,9,8,1,164
"I lie better then that, right?",Joey Tribbiani,9,8,1,165
"So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?",Chandler Bing,9,8,1,166
There's your movie! Later on. Monica opens her front door. Chandler is sitting in the hallway.,Phoebe Buffay,9,8,1,167
Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.,Monica Geller,9,8,1,168
Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?,Chandler Bing,9,8,1,169
Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.,Monica Geller,9,8,1,170
"Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.",Chandler Bing,9,8,1,171
No you learn these things. You grow into it.,Monica Geller,9,8,1,172
"Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.",Chandler Bing,9,8,1,173
I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.,Monica Geller,9,8,1,174
"Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying ""Go to your room! You're grounded""?",Chandler Bing,9,8,1,175
"Can you hear me say ""You're grounded""?",Monica Geller,9,8,1,176
You said that to me last week.,Chandler Bing,9,8,1,177
How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture. Back to Monica and Chandler's apartment. Amy is sitting on a chair by the bay window looking mad. Joey groans and gets off the phone: The producer from Days left a message on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed off at me.. And they all got to meet Santa!,Monica Geller,9,8,1,178
It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.,Phoebe Buffay,9,8,1,179
"Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.",Joey Tribbiani,9,8,1,180
"Ooh, what happened? Joey all nervous and looking down and fiddling with his ear: Oh.. My sister's raccoon.",Phoebe Buffay,9,8,1,181
No! Nothing with a raccoon.,Phoebe Buffay,9,8,1,182
"Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. Monica and Chandler come through the front door.",Joey Tribbiani,9,8,1,183
Oh wait.. What are you doing?,Monica Geller,9,8,1,184
Setting the table.,Joey Tribbiani,9,8,1,185
Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.,Phoebe Buffay,9,8,1,186
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress. Ross comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrying thingy.. yeah.. thats the techinal term.. He goes to Chandler.,Monica Geller,9,8,1,187
"Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.",Ross Geller,9,8,1,188
"Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey. Ross walks away with a face of yeah ok. Amy walks over to the couch and sits down next to Rachel: Ucch. Uchh In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you.",Chandler Bing,9,8,1,189
UCHH!,Rachel Green,9,8,1,190
Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?,Rachel Green,9,8,1,192

Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.,Rachel Green,9,8,1,198
I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you.,Rachel Green,9,8,1,200
Emma.,Ross Geller,9,8,1,201
Oh whose side are you on? I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle the responibility of a child.,Rachel Green,9,8,1,202
ooh oooh..,Joey Tribbiani,9,8,1,204
uh huh.,Rachel Green,9,8,1,206
"Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You, your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?",Rachel Green,9,8,1,208
Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!,Rachel Green,9,8,1,210
"I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today.",Rachel Green,9,8,1,212

What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them.,Joey Tribbiani,9,8,1,232
Ew! Gross.,Rachel Green,9,8,1,233
"Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.",Chandler Bing,9,8,1,234
"Mon, I'm so sorry.",Rachel Green,9,8,1,236
Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.,Chandler Bing,9,8,1,237
"By the way, that fight was totally arousing.",Chandler Bing,9,8,1,239
"Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.",Ross Geller,9,8,1,240
Oh yeah? Well thanks.,Chandler Bing,9,8,1,241
"So, so now do I get Joey?",Ross Geller,9,8,1,242
"Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.",Chandler Bing,9,8,1,243
Are you okay Mon?,Rachel Green,9,8,1,244

Like only if the queen comes?,Monica Geller,9,8,2,7
Maybe not even then.,Chandler Bing,9,8,2,8
"Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie Pheebs.",Joey Tribbiani,9,8,2,9

"But hey, it's courtside. The cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. . . That's not the way to convince you.",Chandler Bing,9,9,1,15
"Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, ""You can't go to the game. You have to spend time with me."" So, if you could just realize it on your own . . .",Monica Geller,9,9,1,16
"I know. You're right. I want to see you too. I've just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know? He's really looking forward to this.",Chandler Bing,9,9,1,17
Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time. Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. Tell him that what little time we have is precious.,Monica Geller,9,9,1,18
"Yeah, ah, ah . . . I'll think of something.",Chandler Bing,9,9,1,19

"Oh well, well thank you. Okay, stop. Stop looking at me like that. The last time that happened, that happened.",Rachel Green,9,9,2,4
"Oh right, right. So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night away from Emma?",Ross Geller,9,9,2,5

"Oh that's so cute: Ross and Mike's first date. Is that going to be awkward? I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?",Rachel Green,9,9,2,12
"I don't know. But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know. He plays piano; I played keyboards in college. He's been divorced; I have some experience in that area.",Ross Geller,9,9,2,13

"I know. So, what's going on with you and Ross?",Phoebe Buffay,9,9,3,3

Oh my God! I love things. What happened?,Phoebe Buffay,9,9,3,5
"Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked. And, ah, then we had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact.",Rachel Green,9,9,3,6

I hope you were using protection.,Phoebe Buffay,9,9,3,9

Oooh. Let's do. Let's send them mashed potatoes.,Phoebe Buffay,9,9,3,12
"No! Wait! No, no. Don't do that! That's going to make them think they can come over here.",Rachel Green,9,9,3,13
So? What if they do?,Phoebe Buffay,9,9,3,14
"Well, we're not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend, I have a b. . . baby and a Ross.",Rachel Green,9,9,3,15
"Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen. We're just having fun. You know, not everything had to go as far as ""eye-contact.""",Phoebe Buffay,9,9,3,16
"Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.",Monica Geller,9,9,4,1
"Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? I heard it.",Chandler Bing,9,9,4,2
I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.,Monica Geller,9,9,4,3
All right. I've got a plan. I'll go down the fire escape.,Chandler Bing,9,9,4,4
"Yes, because all good plans start with, ""I'll go down the fire escape.""",Monica Geller,9,9,4,5
"Hear me out woman. I'll go down the fire escape. Then, I'll wait for a while. Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here.",Chandler Bing,9,9,4,6
Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out? I heard it.,Monica Geller,9,9,4,7
I'm just going to wait for a little while.,Chandler Bing,9,9,4,8
Scary pigeon's back?,Monica Geller,9,9,4,9
It's huge.,Chandler Bing,9,9,4,10
Oh my God. I can't believe you live in that building. My grandmother lives in that building. Ida Green? No sense of personal space? Kind of smells like chicken? Looks like a potato.,Rachel Green,9,9,6,1
That's my bubby!,Rachel Green,9,9,6,3
"Yeah. . . I'm sorry. We weren't really looking for anything to happen with you guys. I, I have a boyfriend.",Phoebe Buffay,9,9,6,5

"Oh my God, you're giving your real number.",Phoebe Buffay,9,9,6,13

"Bye. Wow. So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?",Phoebe Buffay,9,9,6,17
"I don't know. He was cute, and he liked me. It was an impulse.",Rachel Green,9,9,6,18
What about Ross? What about your moment? Don't you want to talk to Ross about it?,Phoebe Buffay,9,9,6,19
"No. No, because I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go. ""Hey Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before.""",Rachel Green,9,9,6,20
"""Yeah."" ""Me too.""",Rachel Green,9,9,6,21
"""Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about it.""",Rachel Green,9,9,6,22
"""Yeah."" ""Me neither.""",Rachel Green,9,9,6,23
"""Well, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we're really feeling?""",Rachel Green,9,9,6,24
"""Yeah. That works for me.""",Rachel Green,9,9,6,25
"Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation.",Phoebe Buffay,9,9,6,26
"Oh, thanks.",Rachel Green,9,9,6,27
"But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.",Phoebe Buffay,9,9,6,28
Wha. . . hey!,Rachel Green,9,9,6,29
Better!,Phoebe Buffay,9,9,6,30
"Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments with Ross, you know? I should just . . . move on with my life.",Rachel Green,9,9,6,31
Really? You're moving on from Ross?,Phoebe Buffay,9,9,6,32
I don't know. Do I have to decide right now?,Rachel Green,9,9,6,33
"Well, you kind of just did. That guy is going to call you tonight. Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.",Phoebe Buffay,9,9,6,34
"Oh God, Ross. Ross is going to pick up the phone. Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone.",Rachel Green,9,9,6,35
"""Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone."" Dead on.",Phoebe Buffay,9,9,6,36
"Wow! That didn't take long. I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight.",Joey Tribbiani,9,9,7,1
"Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.",Chandler Bing,9,9,7,2
Chandler! You're home!,Monica Geller,9,9,7,3
"That's right. You're husband's home. So, now the sex can stop.",Chandler Bing,9,9,7,4
What are you saying?,Monica Geller,9,9,7,5
Joey said that you're in here with another man.,Chandler Bing,9,9,7,6
There's no man in here. How dare you accuse me of that.,Monica Geller,9,9,7,7
"All right. All right. Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh? Bwa-ah-ah!",Joey Tribbiani,9,9,7,8
What is he doing?,Chandler Bing,9,9,7,9
I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.,Monica Geller,9,9,7,10
"Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.",Joey Tribbiani,9,9,7,11
"All right. Well, I'll check the guest room.",Chandler Bing,9,9,7,12
Why do I smell men's cologne?,Joey Tribbiani,9,9,7,13
I think that's you.,Monica Geller,9,9,7,14
Oh yeah. I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.,Joey Tribbiani,9,9,7,15
There's nobody here Joe.,Chandler Bing,9,9,7,16
I guess not.,Joey Tribbiani,9,9,7,17
I can't believe you thought I was cheating. You own me an apology.,Monica Geller,9,9,7,18
"Yeah, right Monica. I'm so sorry.",Joey Tribbiani,9,9,7,19
"Ah, it's an honest mistake. It could happen to anyone. All right, see ya.",Monica Geller,9,9,7,20
"Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?",Joey Tribbiani,9,9,7,21
I climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?,Chandler Bing,9,9,7,22
"Maybe you should look up ""fascinating.""",Ross Geller,9,9,8,2
I don't understand what just happened here.,Ross Geller,9,9,8,4
What's going on?,Joey Tribbiani,9,9,9,1
"I'm sorry. I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . . I didn't think you'd understand.",Chandler Bing,9,9,9,2
"What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be with his wife? Huh? Do you think I'm like, ""Duh.""",Joey Tribbiani,9,9,9,3
Joey?,Monica Geller,9,9,9,4
Yeah?,Joey Tribbiani,9,9,9,5
I don't know what to say. We shouldn't have lied to you.,Monica Geller,9,9,9,6
Yeah. I feel so bad. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?,Chandler Bing,9,9,9,7
"Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldn't. But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.",Joey Tribbiani,9,9,9,8
I'm sorry. That's the one thing I can't do. I promised I'd be with Monica.,Chandler Bing,9,9,9,9

"You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.",Chandler Bing,9,10,2,6

"Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!",Chandler Bing,9,10,2,10
"I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread.

"Haha, no thanks!",Chandler Bing,9,10,2,14

"Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...",Chandler Bing,9,10,2,18
"So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me. ""Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap. Asked him to bring my friends all kinds of crap. Said all you need is to write them a song. Now, you haven't heard it yet, so don't try to sing along. No, don't sing along. Monica, Moncia, have a happy Hanukkah. Saw Santa Claus, he said hello to Ross. And please tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy! And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!"" Happy holidays, everybody!",Phoebe Buffay,9,10,3,1

"No, I have a great idea for a present for her.",Chandler Bing,9,10,4,16
"Oh, that's it? A great idea! Oh yeah.",Phoebe Buffay,9,10,4,17
"Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?",Rachel Green,9,10,4,18
"If I help, we can find 'em faster!",Chandler Bing,9,10,4,19
That's right!,Rachel Green,9,10,4,20

"Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.",Ross Geller,9,10,6,16

Really?,Monica Geller,9,10,11,2
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?,Chandler Bing,9,10,11,3
"Well, not anymore.",Monica Geller,9,10,11,4
But we don't do that.,Chandler Bing,9,10,11,5
"I know, I just thought it would be fun.",Monica Geller,9,10,11,6
How drunk are you?,Chandler Bing,9,10,11,7
Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.,Monica Geller,9,10,11,8
That's the perfect amount!,Chandler Bing,9,10,11,9
Okay!,Monica Geller,9,10,11,10
Y'know what's weird?,Monica Geller,9,10,11,11
What?,Chandler Bing,9,10,11,12
This doesn't feel weird!,Monica Geller,9,10,11,13
I know.,Chandler Bing,9,10,11,14
You're a really good kisser.,Monica Geller,9,10,11,15

It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.,Chandler Bing,9,10,11,20
We're gonna see each other naked.,Monica Geller,9,10,11,21
Yep!,Chandler Bing,9,10,11,22
Do you wanna do it at the same time?,Monica Geller,9,10,11,23
Count of three?,Chandler Bing,9,10,11,24
One!,Monica Geller,9,10,11,25
Two!,Chandler Bing,9,10,11,26
Two!,Monica Geller,9,10,11,27
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.,Chandler Bing,9,10,11,29
"Eh, we weren't that close anyway!",Monica Geller,9,10,11,30
Eh!,Chandler Bing,9,10,11,31
"So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?",Chandler Bing,9,10,12,1
"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.",Monica Geller,9,10,12,2
"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.",Chandler Bing,9,10,12,3
I think you're better than you think you are.,Monica Geller,9,10,12,4
"Really? Okay, so...",Chandler Bing,9,10,12,5
Know when to stop.,Monica Geller,9,10,12,6
"Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?",Chandler Bing,9,10,12,7
Yeah. Don't do the dance.,Monica Geller,9,10,12,8
Right!,Chandler Bing,9,10,12,9
"I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.",Monica Geller,9,10,13,1
"Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.",Chandler Bing,9,10,13,2
You're so efficient. I love you!,Monica Geller,9,10,13,3
Let's go!,Chandler Bing,9,10,13,4
"No-no-no, wait! We need something old!",Monica Geller,9,10,13,5
"Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.",Chandler Bing,9,10,13,6
That'll work!,Monica Geller,9,10,13,7
I don't think so.,Chandler Bing,9,10,13,8
"Okay, now we just need something borrowed!",Monica Geller,9,10,13,9
Here just...take this.,Chandler Bing,9,10,13,10
That's stealing!,Monica Geller,9,10,13,11
"No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.",Chandler Bing,9,10,13,12
Ohh.,Monica Geller,9,10,13,13
"Okay, one thing at a time.",Chandler Bing,9,10,13,14
"Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.",Monica Geller,9,10,14,1
Ehh.,Chandler Bing,9,10,14,2
"Eh, you work for that.",Monica Geller,9,10,14,3
"Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.",Chandler Bing,9,10,14,4
You do?!,Monica Geller,9,10,14,5
"Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.",Chandler Bing,9,10,14,6
"Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?",Monica Geller,9,10,14,7
"Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.",Chandler Bing,9,10,14,8
You thought about that?,Monica Geller,9,10,14,9
Yeah.,Chandler Bing,9,10,14,10
How many kids were we gonna have?,Monica Geller,9,10,14,11
"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.",Chandler Bing,9,10,14,12
What else did you think about?,Monica Geller,9,10,14,13
"Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.",Chandler Bing,9,10,14,14
"Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.",Monica Geller,9,10,14,15
Sure you do.,Chandler Bing,9,10,14,16
"No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.",Monica Geller,9,10,14,17
You sure?,Chandler Bing,9,10,14,18
Uh-hmm.,Monica Geller,9,10,14,19
I love you so much.,Chandler Bing,9,10,14,20
I love you.,Monica Geller,9,10,14,21

"Well, not this second!",Rachel Green,9,10,15,3
"Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!",Phoebe Buffay,9,10,15,4
"Oh wow, it's so beautiful...",Rachel Green,9,10,15,5
"Wow, it really is!",Ross Geller,9,10,15,6
"""Wendy"" is a fat girl name.",Monica Geller,9,10,15,7
Aren't we done with that?,Phoebe Buffay,9,10,15,8
"Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?",Monica Geller,9,10,15,9
Hey!,Chandler Bing,9,10,15,10
Oh my god...,Ross Geller,9,10,15,11
"Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!",Joey Tribbiani,9,10,15,12

I never want to leave you again!,Chandler Bing,9,10,15,18
"But I thought if you left, you get fired.",Monica Geller,9,10,15,19
Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.,Chandler Bing,9,10,15,20
What?,Monica Geller,9,10,15,21
"What, you, you really quit your job?",Ross Geller,9,10,15,22
"Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?",Chandler Bing,9,10,15,23
What do you really want to do?,Rachel Green,9,10,15,24
I have *not* thought this through!,Chandler Bing,9,10,15,25
Oh my god!,Monica Geller,9,10,15,26
"I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.",Chandler Bing,9,10,15,27
"No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!",Monica Geller,9,10,15,28
Thanks!,Chandler Bing,9,10,15,29
"Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.",Phoebe Buffay,9,10,15,30
Ahh...,Chandler Bing,9,10,15,31
Now give me my real gift.,Phoebe Buffay,9,10,15,32
Thank you.,Phoebe Buffay,9,10,15,33

"I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.",Chandler Bing,9,10,15,38
Mine's is to Lilian Myers.,Joey Tribbiani,9,10,15,39
I don't have a *job*! *Closing Credits*,Chandler Bing,9,10,15,40
"Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!",Chandler Bing,9,10,16,1
"You are! Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?",Monica Geller,9,10,16,2
Hey!,Chandler Bing,9,11,1,1
"Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant.",Monica Geller,9,11,1,2
I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.,Chandler Bing,9,11,1,3
"Well, I just lost my erection.",Monica Geller,9,11,1,4
"I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?",Chandler Bing,9,11,1,5
You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.,Monica Geller,9,11,1,6
But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.,Chandler Bing,9,11,1,7
"Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!",Monica Geller,9,11,1,8
Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!,Chandler Bing,9,11,1,9
I know!!! My erection is back!,Monica Geller,9,11,1,10
Thank you!,Joey Tribbiani,9,11,2,1
"Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,2,2
Okay. Phoebe Thank you. Thank you!,Joey Tribbiani,9,11,2,3
": Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian?",Joey Tribbiani,9,11,2,4
"I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,2,5
If you want I could loan you some money?,Joey Tribbiani,9,11,2,6
"Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,2,7
"Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?",Joey Tribbiani,9,11,2,8
You could do that?,Phoebe Buffay,9,11,2,9
"Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.",Joey Tribbiani,9,11,2,10
"Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,2,11
"Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.",Joey Tribbiani,9,11,2,12
"Oh, really?",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,2,13
No it is awesome!,Joey Tribbiani,9,11,2,14
Hi guys.,Ross Geller,9,11,2,15
"Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,2,17
Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?,Ross Geller,9,11,2,18
She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?,Joey Tribbiani,9,11,2,19
"Well, because if one more person says ""what a cute little boy"" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!",Rachel Green,9,11,2,20
"I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?",Ross Geller,9,11,2,21
"Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.",Monica Geller,9,11,3,1
How long was I in there?,Chandler Bing,9,11,3,2
Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.,Monica Geller,9,11,3,3
Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!,Chandler Bing,9,11,3,4
Don't you want to look through the rest?,Monica Geller,9,11,3,5
"I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.",Chandler Bing,9,11,3,6
"You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!",Monica Geller,9,11,3,7
"I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? ""Cheese. It's milk that you chew."" ""Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy."" ""A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?""",Chandler Bing,9,11,3,8
"I got one. ""Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best.""",Monica Geller,9,11,3,9
Honey? Leave it to the pros.,Chandler Bing,9,11,3,10
I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.,Monica Geller,9,11,3,11
"""The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones.""",Chandler Bing,9,11,3,12
"""Marriage. It's not for everybody.""",Monica Geller,9,11,3,13
That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.,Rachel Green,9,11,4,1
"Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.",Ross Geller,9,11,4,2
I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . Who the hell are you!?,Rachel Green,9,11,4,3
I'm the hell person whose office this is!,Rachel Green,9,11,4,5
"Good one, Rach.",Ross Geller,9,11,4,6
Excuse me?,Rachel Green,9,11,4,8
"Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,5,1
"Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?",Joey Tribbiani,9,11,5,2
Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.,Phoebe Buffay,9,11,5,3
"Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back.",Joey Tribbiani,9,11,5,4
"Okay, now. What?",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,5,6
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,5,9
"Okay, that helps.",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,5,11
"Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too! Alright, eight.",Joey Tribbiani,9,11,5,14
"No, no. But let me show you what I can do. ""Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood.""",Chandler Bing,9,11,6,2
Really? That's great!,Chandler Bing,9,11,6,4
"It's funny. When you said ""unpaid"" it sounded like you said ""unpaid.""",Chandler Bing,9,11,6,6
"Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.",Chandler Bing,9,11,6,8
"Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?",Rachel Green,9,11,7,1
A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.,Rachel Green,9,11,7,3
"Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office.",Rachel Green,9,11,7,5
Excuse me?,Rachel Green,9,11,7,7
Rach we have a code brown situation.,Ross Geller,9,11,7,8
"Can you please, please take care of it for me?",Rachel Green,9,11,7,9
"Alright, but you have to do one sometime.",Ross Geller,9,11,7,10
Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?,Rachel Green,9,11,7,11
That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.,Rachel Green,9,11,7,13
"Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?",Rachel Green,9,11,7,15
Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?,Rachel Green,9,11,7,17
"Oh, hi Mr. Zelner.",Rachel Green,9,11,7,19
"That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?",Rachel Green,9,11,7,21
"Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.",Rachel Green,9,11,7,23
Today.,Rachel Green,9,11,7,25
"No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.",Rachel Green,9,11,7,27
Hey.,Joey Tribbiani,9,11,8,1
"Hey. So, what did he say?",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,8,2
"Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word ""puppy."" Okay, So He Said ""If your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, I'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass.""",Joey Tribbiani,9,11,8,3
"I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor.",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,8,4
"That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray.",Joey Tribbiani,9,11,8,5
Joey.,Phoebe Buffay,9,11,8,6
"No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!",Joey Tribbiani,9,11,8,7
Who dies?,Phoebe Buffay,9,11,8,8
Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.,Joey Tribbiani,9,11,8,9
"Yes, doctor.",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,8,10
Okay.,Joey Tribbiani,9,11,8,11
"Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,8,13
"Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,8,15
"Okay, from the top, people!",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,8,17
"Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me.",Rachel Green,9,11,9,1
"What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...",Ross Geller,9,11,9,2
"Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.",Rachel Green,9,11,9,3
What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.,Ross Geller,9,11,9,4
"I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?",Rachel Green,9,11,9,5
Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.,Ross Geller,9,11,9,6

Ross?,Rachel Green,9,11,9,9
Huh?,Ross Geller,9,11,9,10
You're pretty.,Rachel Green,9,11,9,11
"Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.",Chandler Bing,9,11,10,1
So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?,Ross Geller,9,11,10,2
Yeah.,Chandler Bing,9,11,10,3
Good-bye.,Ross Geller,9,11,10,4
"Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing. Didn't see you there Geller.",Monica Geller,9,11,10,5
"Yeah, Ross is here so...",Chandler Bing,9,11,10,6
"Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?",Ross Geller,9,11,10,7
We're gonna have sex.,Monica Geller,9,11,10,8
I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.,Ross Geller,9,11,10,9
Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not.,Monica Geller,9,11,10,10
Pants off Bing!,Ross Geller,9,11,10,11
"Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?",Rachel Green,9,11,11,1
"Hey, they were popular when I left!",Rachel Green,9,11,11,3
"Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?",Rachel Green,9,11,11,5
"Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up!",Rachel Green,9,11,11,7
Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?,Rachel Green,9,11,11,9
"Fine, I will. Alright, fill me in!",Rachel Green,9,11,11,11
Hey.,Ross Geller,9,11,12,1
Hey.,Chandler Bing,9,11,12,2
You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.,Ross Geller,9,11,12,3
"Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.",Chandler Bing,9,11,12,4
"Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.",Monica Geller,9,11,12,5
Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!,Ross Geller,9,11,12,6
Sorry. But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.,Monica Geller,9,11,12,7
"Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant.",Chandler Bing,9,11,12,8
What are you talking about?,Monica Geller,9,11,12,9
That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.,Chandler Bing,9,11,12,10
What!? You faked it?,Monica Geller,9,11,12,11
"You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual.",Ross Geller,9,11,12,12
"Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,13,1
"Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.",Joey Tribbiani,9,11,13,2
"Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,13,3
"Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.",Joey Tribbiani,9,11,13,4
"Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,13,5
Nice.,Joey Tribbiani,9,11,13,6
Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?,Phoebe Buffay,9,11,13,7
"No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.",Joey Tribbiani,9,11,13,8
About what?,Phoebe Buffay,9,11,13,9
He slept with you and then never called you.,Joey Tribbiani,9,11,13,10
And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.,Phoebe Buffay,9,11,13,11
"Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,13,16
"Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!",Joey Tribbiani,9,11,13,19
"Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything!",Rachel Green,9,11,14,2
"Except that! Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.",Rachel Green,9,11,14,4
"What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.",Rachel Green,9,11,14,6
"Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!",Rachel Green,9,11,14,8
"No, I can't, I have a baby.",Rachel Green,9,11,14,10
Why would you do that?,Rachel Green,9,11,14,12
That's really nice.,Rachel Green,9,11,14,14
"Then you're not gonna like what's coming. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.",Rachel Green,9,11,14,16
Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.,Joey Tribbiani,9,11,15,1
"Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?",Joey Tribbiani,9,11,15,3
"Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?",Joey Tribbiani,9,11,15,4
I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.,Phoebe Buffay,9,11,15,5
You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.,Joey Tribbiani,9,11,15,6
"Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened.",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,15,7
What?,Joey Tribbiani,9,11,15,8
"Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!",Phoebe Buffay,9,11,15,9
"Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy.",Joey Tribbiani,9,11,15,10
You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!,Monica Geller,9,11,16,1
Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.,Chandler Bing,9,11,16,2
"Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?",Monica Geller,9,11,16,3
"That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.",Chandler Bing,9,11,16,4
Like a month?,Monica Geller,9,11,16,5
Or a year?,Chandler Bing,9,11,16,6
"Really, you want to wait a year?",Monica Geller,9,11,16,7
"It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. ""Pants. Like shorts, but longer."" It'll probably be more than a year.",Chandler Bing,9,11,16,8
I really wanna have a baby.,Monica Geller,9,11,16,9
"Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.",Chandler Bing,9,11,16,10
"No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.",Monica Geller,9,11,16,11
I quit and you learn what I do?,Chandler Bing,9,11,16,12
"It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.",Monica Geller,9,11,16,13
I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.,Chandler Bing,9,11,16,14
"It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!",Monica Geller,9,11,16,15
Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?,Chandler Bing,9,11,16,16
"Yes, please!",Monica Geller,9,11,16,17
"Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.",Chandler Bing,9,11,16,18
I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!,Monica Geller,9,11,16,19
What about my children Drake?! Huh!? No!! No!! No! God!,Phoebe Buffay,9,11,16,22
Hey.,Chandler Bing,9,12,1,1
Hey. So where's Mon?,Joey Tribbiani,9,12,1,2
"Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.",Chandler Bing,9,12,1,3
And you're not helping?,Joey Tribbiani,9,12,1,4
"I tried, but apparantly singing ""I will survive"" in a helium voice - not helping.",Chandler Bing,9,12,1,5
Hey you guys!,Ross Geller,9,12,1,6
"Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.",Rachel Green,9,12,1,8
"Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly . Molly, Chandler, Joey.",Ross Geller,9,12,1,9
"Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.",Ross Geller,9,12,1,12
"You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.",Joey Tribbiani,9,12,1,13
"Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.",Rachel Green,9,12,1,14
"OK, thank you.",Rachel Green,9,12,1,16
"Yeah, you too.",Joey Tribbiani,9,12,1,18
"Oh, wow, Molly is just great!",Rachel Green,9,12,1,19
Yeah.,Ross Geller,9,12,1,20
"Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.",Chandler Bing,9,12,1,21
What? You really think she's hot?,Rachel Green,9,12,1,22
Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.,Chandler Bing,9,12,1,23
And Joey?,Rachel Green,9,12,1,24
How do you think she's doing?,Joey Tribbiani,9,12,1,25
Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?,Rachel Green,9,12,1,26
"Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....",Ross Geller,9,12,1,27
Thank you!,Rachel Green,9,12,1,28
Now that Rachel's gone?,Chandler Bing,9,12,1,29
So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.,Rachel Green,9,12,1,30
"Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,2,1
"No. It starts with a ""v"" and ends with an ""x"". Helpfully with a ""to"" in the middle.",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,2,3
What?,Phoebe Buffay,9,12,2,5
"Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,2,7
"Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,2,9
What are those?,Phoebe Buffay,9,12,2,11
"OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,2,13
"So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers.",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,2,15
Hello.,Rachel Green,9,12,3,1
"Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.",Rachel Green,9,12,3,3
"Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...",Rachel Green,9,12,3,5
"No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.",Rachel Green,9,12,3,7
"Hello. But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy ... I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished.",Rachel Green,9,12,3,9
I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!,Rachel Green,9,12,3,11
"Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.",Rachel Green,9,12,3,13
"Oh yeah, I'm jealous. ""Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass"". Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate.",Rachel Green,9,12,3,15
"That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.",Rachel Green,9,12,3,17
"It was ... oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just ""Tag"". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.",Rachel Green,9,12,3,19
"Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!",Rachel Green,9,12,3,21
"Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?",Rachel Green,9,12,3,23
"Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.",Joey Tribbiani,9,12,4,1
Sure.,Joey Tribbiani,9,12,4,3
Would you stop staring at her?,Monica Geller,9,12,4,4
I wasn't staring. I was leering.,Chandler Bing,9,12,4,5
What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.,Monica Geller,9,12,4,6
"Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.",Ross Geller,9,12,4,7
Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.,Chandler Bing,9,12,4,8
"Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.",Monica Geller,9,12,4,9
"Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you - wovyou dovyou ...",Ross Geller,9,12,4,11
They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.,Monica Geller,9,12,4,13
"Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.",Rachel Green,9,12,4,16
Why not?,Joey Tribbiani,9,12,4,17
"Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.",Rachel Green,9,12,4,18
"So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? Yeah, sounds about right.",Joey Tribbiani,9,12,4,19
"Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.",Ross Geller,9,12,4,20
"Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!",Joey Tribbiani,9,12,4,21
"What are you, a child?",Ross Geller,9,12,4,22
Yes!,Joey Tribbiani,9,12,4,23
"Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.",Ross Geller,9,12,4,24
Fine.,Joey Tribbiani,9,12,4,25
Take me home!,Monica Geller,9,12,4,26
Hey Mikey.,Phoebe Buffay,9,12,5,1
What are you doing?,Phoebe Buffay,9,12,5,3
To kill Bob??,Phoebe Buffay,9,12,5,5
"No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,5,7
"I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? Bob! Robert! Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,5,9
"I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,5,11
"Oh my god, we killed Bob!",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,5,13
Suzie?,Phoebe Buffay,9,12,5,15
Whazzup??,Ross Geller,9,12,6,1
"Seriously dude, 3 years ago.",Chandler Bing,9,12,6,2
"Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?",Ross Geller,9,12,6,3
You don't trust him?,Chandler Bing,9,12,6,4
"Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the ""hot nanny"".",Ross Geller,9,12,6,5
"Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.",Chandler Bing,9,12,6,6
"You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?",Ross Geller,9,12,6,7
"Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.",Chandler Bing,9,12,6,8
"Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees.",Ross Geller,9,12,6,9
Picturing that tree?,Chandler Bing,9,12,6,10
"I am, yes.",Ross Geller,9,12,6,11
"Where you going, Joe?",Chandler Bing,9,12,7,1
For a walk.,Joey Tribbiani,9,12,7,2
Oh. You mind if I join you?,Chandler Bing,9,12,7,3
"Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.",Joey Tribbiani,9,12,7,4
Your thoughts? Plural?,Chandler Bing,9,12,7,5
"Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!",Joey Tribbiani,9,12,7,6
"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.",Chandler Bing,9,12,7,7
"Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?",Joey Tribbiani,9,12,7,8
"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.",Chandler Bing,9,12,7,9
Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.,Joey Tribbiani,9,12,7,10
Great novels?,Chandler Bing,9,12,7,11
Fine ... mediocre porn.,Joey Tribbiani,9,12,7,12
"Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll pass you back to your son.",Rachel Green,9,12,8,2
"Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.",Rachel Green,9,12,8,4
If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?,Rachel Green,9,12,8,6
"Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you, you ""momma's boy"", starting right now.",Rachel Green,9,12,8,8
Hey Rach!,Monica Geller,9,12,8,9
Hi!,Rachel Green,9,12,8,10
Ready for your birthday lunch?,Monica Geller,9,12,8,11
"Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle.",Rachel Green,9,12,8,12
Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?,Monica Geller,9,12,8,14
"Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother.",Rachel Green,9,12,8,15
Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!,Rachel Green,9,12,8,17
You were just being so nice to him!,Monica Geller,9,12,8,18
I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?,Rachel Green,9,12,8,19
"Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!",Rachel Green,9,12,8,20
Right there! That was so fake!,Monica Geller,9,12,8,21
Shh!,Rachel Green,9,12,8,22
"I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.",Rachel Green,9,12,9,1
"Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.",Monica Geller,9,12,9,2
"God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.",Rachel Green,9,12,9,3
Does he?,Monica Geller,9,12,9,4
What?,Rachel Green,9,12,9,5
Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?,Monica Geller,9,12,9,6
"Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.",Rachel Green,9,12,9,7
"Oh, ok, thank you. Do you see what all the guys see in her?",Rachel Green,9,12,9,9
Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me!,Monica Geller,9,12,9,10
"Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?",Joey Tribbiani,9,12,9,11
"Yeah, sure!",Rachel Green,9,12,9,12
"Oh ... Happy birth ... oh, see you later.",Joey Tribbiani,9,12,9,13
"Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!",Monica Geller,9,12,9,14
"Oh, give me!",Rachel Green,9,12,9,15
"Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,9,16
"Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?",Rachel Green,9,12,9,18
So this is what a stroke feels like.,Monica Geller,9,12,9,19
"I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,9,20
Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?,Rachel Green,9,12,9,21
"No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,9,22
"whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?",Rachel Green,9,12,9,23
"Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help.",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,9,24
Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.,Ross Geller,9,12,9,25
"I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.",Chandler Bing,9,12,9,26
We have to stop them before something happens!,Ross Geller,9,12,9,27
"Right behind you, big guy!",Chandler Bing,9,12,9,28
"So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.",Joey Tribbiani,9,12,10,1
"Oh, I didn't go to college.",Joey Tribbiani,9,12,10,3
Molly ... people don't study acting ...,Joey Tribbiani,9,12,10,5
"Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?",Ross Geller,9,12,10,6
Thanx.,Ross Geller,9,12,10,8
Will the stable boy never get the princess??,Joey Tribbiani,9,12,10,9
"What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?",Ross Geller,9,12,10,10
"No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.",Joey Tribbiani,9,12,10,11
Ok.,Joey Tribbiani,9,12,10,13
"Yeah, come on in. Molly?",Ross Geller,9,12,10,15
"Ok ... Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have no problem.",Ross Geller,9,12,10,17
"It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!",Joey Tribbiani,9,12,10,18
"Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,11,1
"Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,11,3
Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.,Phoebe Buffay,9,12,11,5
"No. wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,11,7
"Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites.",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,11,9
You must think I'm crazy.,Phoebe Buffay,9,12,11,11
"Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. I haven't told you about that yet, have I?",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,11,13
Hey!,Monica Geller,9,12,12,1
"Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?",Rachel Green,9,12,12,2
"No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?",Monica Geller,9,12,12,3
"Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.",Rachel Green,9,12,12,4
"Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up .",Monica Geller,9,12,12,5
Mmm hmm.,Rachel Green,9,12,12,6
"Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.",Monica Geller,9,12,12,8
No.,Rachel Green,9,12,12,9
"Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ...",Rachel Green,9,12,12,11
"Again, you're welcome.",Monica Geller,9,12,12,12
"Oh, you bought me a present! Why?",Rachel Green,9,12,12,14
"Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card . ""From Gavin""",Rachel Green,9,12,12,16
"Awww, awww, it's beautiful.",Rachel Green,9,12,12,18
"See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?",Rachel Green,9,12,12,20
Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.,Rachel Green,9,12,12,22
You do?,Rachel Green,9,12,12,24
"See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... and you do that ...",Rachel Green,9,12,12,26
"First I was afraid, I was petrified.",Chandler Bing,9,12,12,27
Hey.,Phoebe Buffay,9,12,12,28
Hi.,Chandler Bing,9,12,12,29
"Listen, I think I've left something here.",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,12,30
"Oh, well someone left this . This is yours?",Chandler Bing,9,12,12,31
"No, but I like it. I think I left one of my rat babies.",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,12,32
"Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.",Chandler Bing,9,12,12,33
Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!,Monica Geller,9,12,12,34
"Ooh, maybe that's him!",Phoebe Buffay,9,12,12,35
Hey!,Chandler Bing,9,13,1,1
Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?,Ross Geller,9,13,1,2
Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!,Chandler Bing,9,13,1,3
OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?,Ross Geller,9,13,1,4
No!,Chandler Bing,9,13,1,5
OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.,Ross Geller,9,13,1,6
"Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said""No, no. It's too cold, nobody will go out there."" And I said ""Maybe if we put some light out there they will""",Chandler Bing,9,13,1,7
"Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were NO LIGHTS !",Ross Geller,9,13,1,8
So are you gonna...talk to her?,Chandler Bing,9,13,1,9
"Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!",Ross Geller,9,13,1,10
"You know when ""That's fine"" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!",Chandler Bing,9,13,1,11
"No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You knowI...I've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys shebarely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah! Ah!",Ross Geller,9,13,1,12
No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?,Chandler Bing,9,13,1,13
"I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.And then the other day on the subway a woman ""accidentally"" sat on my hand.",Ross Geller,9,13,1,14
"Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!",Chandler Bing,9,13,1,15
"Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmentalPotluck dinner.",Ross Geller,9,13,1,16
Why did I get married?!,Chandler Bing,9,13,1,17
Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks Ishould have my eyebrows waxed. Is that weird for a guy?,Joey Tribbiani,9,13,2,1
Well it depends.,Phoebe Buffay,9,13,2,2
On...?,Joey Tribbiani,9,13,2,3
On how far along he's in the sex change process!,Phoebe Buffay,9,13,2,4
"No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,your eyebrows are...",Monica Geller,9,13,2,5
Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!,Joey Tribbiani,9,13,2,6
Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...,Phoebe Buffay,9,13,2,7
Oh man! I have to get those done too?!,Joey Tribbiani,9,13,2,8
Wow! Talking about high maintenance.,Phoebe Buffay,9,13,2,9

"Well, actually it...",Joey Tribbiani,9,14,1,19
"No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.",Ross Geller,9,14,1,20
"Wow, really?",Joey Tribbiani,9,14,1,21

"Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.",Phoebe Buffay,9,14,2,7
Why are they doing this?,Joey Tribbiani,9,14,2,8
I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.,Phoebe Buffay,9,14,2,9
"You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?",Joey Tribbiani,9,14,2,10
I just wish they'd realise they should be together.,Phoebe Buffay,9,14,2,11
"I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.",Joey Tribbiani,9,14,2,12
I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.,Phoebe Buffay,9,14,2,13
"Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.",Joey Tribbiani,9,14,2,14
"You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.",Phoebe Buffay,9,14,2,15
"Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.",Joey Tribbiani,9,14,2,16
"So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?",Phoebe Buffay,9,14,2,17
I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.,Joey Tribbiani,9,14,2,18
"Yeah. Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.",Phoebe Buffay,9,14,2,19
"Ooh, that's a great plan!",Joey Tribbiani,9,14,2,20
"Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my ""plan-laugh.""",Phoebe Buffay,9,14,2,21
"Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...",Joey Tribbiani,9,14,2,22
Hey!,Rachel Green,9,14,3,1
Hey!,Monica Geller,9,14,3,2
"You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?",Rachel Green,9,14,3,3
"See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.",Chandler Bing,9,14,3,4
I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.,Rachel Green,9,14,3,5
"Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?",Monica Geller,9,14,3,6
"Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.",Rachel Green,9,14,3,7
Oh my god.,Monica Geller,9,14,3,8
Wow.,Chandler Bing,9,14,3,9
Why? What's the big deal?,Rachel Green,9,14,3,10
"Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...",Monica Geller,9,14,3,11
"What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.",Rachel Green,9,14,3,12
"Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!",Chandler Bing,9,14,3,13
"You want a job? Turn off ""Oprah,"" and send out a resume!",Monica Geller,9,14,3,14
So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?,Rachel Green,9,14,3,15
"Oh, it's perfect.",Monica Geller,9,14,3,16
"Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!",Rachel Green,9,14,3,17
Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.,Chandler Bing,9,14,3,18
"Ooh, Joey.",Phoebe Buffay,9,14,4,1
Hey.,Joey Tribbiani,9,14,4,2
Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.,Phoebe Buffay,9,14,4,3

"Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.",Joey Tribbiani,9,14,4,6
"Oh, yeah.",Phoebe Buffay,9,14,4,7
She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!,Joey Tribbiani,9,14,4,8
A teacher?,Phoebe Buffay,9,14,4,9
"Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?",Joey Tribbiani,9,14,4,10

"Oh my god, you're right!",Joey Tribbiani,9,14,4,12
Yeah.,Phoebe Buffay,9,14,4,13
She even reads for pleasure!,Joey Tribbiani,9,14,4,14
How do you even know a woman like that?,Phoebe Buffay,9,14,4,15
What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?,Joey Tribbiani,9,14,4,16
Joey.,Phoebe Buffay,9,14,4,17
I met her at the library. I went in to pee.,Joey Tribbiani,9,14,4,18
So now what do we do?,Phoebe Buffay,9,14,4,19
"Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.",Joey Tribbiani,9,14,4,20
"What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!",Phoebe Buffay,9,14,4,21
Ooh...I hear that's bad.,Joey Tribbiani,9,14,4,22
"Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.",Phoebe Buffay,9,14,4,23
"Ah, yes, The Plan!",Joey Tribbiani,9,14,4,24
"It's not Santa's plan. No, it's...",Phoebe Buffay,9,14,4,25
"Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.",Joey Tribbiani,9,14,4,26
"No, I think we killed it.",Phoebe Buffay,9,14,4,27
"Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.",Chandler Bing,9,14,5,1
"No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!",Chandler Bing,9,14,5,2
"Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.",Monica Geller,9,14,5,3
I don't do that.,Chandler Bing,9,14,5,4
"I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?",Chandler Bing,9,14,5,5
Yeah.,Monica Geller,9,14,5,6
Today is the sixth.,Chandler Bing,9,14,5,7
"No, it's not.",Monica Geller,9,14,5,8
"Yes, it's also 2003.",Chandler Bing,9,14,5,9
Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.,Monica Geller,9,14,5,10
It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.,Chandler Bing,9,14,5,11
Okay.,Monica Geller,9,14,5,12
Tough crib.,Chandler Bing,9,14,5,13
"Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.",Monica Geller,9,14,5,14
I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.,Chandler Bing,9,14,5,15
Chandler!,Monica Geller,9,14,5,16
I am not working. There's not much to do around here!,Chandler Bing,9,14,5,17
"Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?",Ross Geller,9,14,6,1
"Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.",Ross Geller,9,14,6,3
"Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.",Ross Geller,9,14,6,5
"Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.",Ross Geller,9,14,6,7
No!,Ross Geller,9,14,6,9
We're okay. I'm still ovulating.,Monica Geller,9,14,7,1
"Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.",Chandler Bing,9,14,7,2
"So, let's do this.",Monica Geller,9,14,7,3
I - I don't think I can.,Chandler Bing,9,14,7,4
"Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.",Monica Geller,9,14,7,5
Because of Emma.,Chandler Bing,9,14,7,6
"Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.",Monica Geller,9,14,7,7
Sorry.,Chandler Bing,9,14,7,8
"Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?",Monica Geller,9,14,7,9
"Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.",Chandler Bing,9,14,7,10
Canoodling?,Monica Geller,9,14,7,11
"Well, I can't say ""hump"" or ""screw"" in front of the B-A-B-Y.",Chandler Bing,9,14,7,12
"I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...",Monica Geller,9,14,7,13
Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?,Chandler Bing,9,14,7,14
I guess you're right.,Monica Geller,9,14,7,15
"You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.",Chandler Bing,9,14,7,16
But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?,Monica Geller,9,14,7,17
"Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.",Rachel Green,9,14,8,1
"Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.",Rachel Green,9,14,8,3
What?,Rachel Green,9,14,8,5
"So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really excited about that chicken.",Rachel Green,9,14,8,7
"Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.",Rachel Green,9,14,8,9
Really? What's that like?,Rachel Green,9,14,8,12
"Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something that you like about yourself.",Rachel Green,9,14,8,14

"You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.",Phoebe Buffay,9,14,9,5
I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!,Rachel Green,9,14,9,6
"Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.",Phoebe Buffay,9,14,9,7
He's not stoned.,Rachel Green,9,14,9,8
Did he go out for a cigarette?,Phoebe Buffay,9,14,9,9
"Yeah, four times.",Rachel Green,9,14,9,10
"My dear, sweet Rach.",Phoebe Buffay,9,14,9,11
"Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.",Phoebe Buffay,9,14,9,12
"Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.",Joey Tribbiani,9,14,9,13
"By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico. Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.",Phoebe Buffay,9,14,9,14
She's asleep. Chandler?,Monica Geller,9,14,10,1

"Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise.",Chandler Bing,9,14,10,7
"Okay, I'll try.",Monica Geller,9,14,10,8
Hello?,Joey Tribbiani,9,14,10,9
Emma? Hey! Hi!,Joey Tribbiani,9,14,10,10
"How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?",Joey Tribbiani,9,14,10,11
"You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!",Joey Tribbiani,9,14,10,12
"Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.",Ross Geller,9,14,11,2

What? You - you're making money off my misery?,Ross Geller,9,14,11,11

"Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.",Monica Geller,9,14,12,1
I think we may have really done it this time.,Chandler Bing,9,14,12,2
"Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.",Monica Geller,9,14,12,3
You may wanna get some more of those too.,Chandler Bing,9,14,12,4
Where's Emma?,Chandler Bing,9,14,12,5
"Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?",Monica Geller,9,14,12,6
"Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!",Chandler Bing,9,14,12,7
"Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.",Monica Geller,9,14,12,8
Okay.,Chandler Bing,9,14,12,9
"Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel.",Monica Geller,9,14,12,10
"No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.",Rachel Green,9,14,13,2
Don't touch my coat!,Rachel Green,9,14,13,4
"Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?",Rachel Green,9,14,13,5
"Hey, Rach, how's it going?",Monica Geller,9,14,13,6
"Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!",Rachel Green,9,14,13,7
"Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? What's up?",Rachel Green,9,14,13,8
"Hey, did you stop by here?",Monica Geller,9,14,13,9

"Oh, we were playing ""peek-a-boo."" She just - she loves it when I'm dramatic.",Monica Geller,9,14,13,14

Because you two were having sex!,Joey Tribbiani,9,14,13,16
"No, we weren't!",Monica Geller,9,14,13,17
Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?,Joey Tribbiani,9,14,13,18
"All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.",Chandler Bing,9,14,13,19
Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.,Joey Tribbiani,9,14,13,20
"No, no, no.",Chandler Bing,9,14,13,21
"No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!",Monica Geller,9,14,13,22
"Hey, I gotta! Unless...",Joey Tribbiani,9,14,13,23

Monica told me you had a blind date.,Ross Geller,9,14,14,12
Yeah.,Rachel Green,9,14,14,13
"I did, too.",Ross Geller,9,14,14,14
Oh.,Rachel Green,9,14,14,15
But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?,Ross Geller,9,14,14,16
"Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?",Rachel Green,9,14,14,17
Why does everyone keep saying that?,Ross Geller,9,14,14,18
"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.",Rachel Green,9,14,14,19
That bad?,Ross Geller,9,14,14,20

"The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.",Ross Geller,9,14,14,30

"Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.",Ross Geller,9,14,14,32

"O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. . Oh my god, I can't find my wallet.",Ross Geller,9,15,5,7
No.,Phoebe Buffay,9,15,5,9
"What do you mean ""no""? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay.",Ross Geller,9,15,5,10
"Lowell, is that you?",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,5,11
Oh my god!,Phoebe Buffay,9,15,5,13
"I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross.",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,5,14
"Yeah, a real pleasure.",Ross Geller,9,15,5,16
"Ah, it's been so long, so long. I can't believe you're still doing this!",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,5,17
Good for you!,Phoebe Buffay,9,15,5,19
Ouh...,Phoebe Buffay,9,15,5,21
"Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people?",Ross Geller,9,15,5,22
"Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up.",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,5,23
"Hey, how did the audition go?",Monica Geller,9,15,6,1
"Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me.",Joey Tribbiani,9,15,6,2
What happened?,Monica Geller,9,15,6,3
"Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less.",Joey Tribbiani,9,15,6,4
So far so good!,Monica Geller,9,15,6,5
"Honey, I'm old!",Chandler Bing,9,15,6,6
What's wrong?,Monica Geller,9,15,6,7
I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.,Chandler Bing,9,15,6,8
So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.,Monica Geller,9,15,6,9
"Yes, but I don't think life experience with these.",Chandler Bing,9,15,6,10
Wooooooooow It's like they're on fire!,Joey Tribbiani,9,15,6,11
What are they?,Monica Geller,9,15,6,12
They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.,Chandler Bing,9,15,6,13
I give you $ 500 for them!,Joey Tribbiani,9,15,6,14
What am I supposed to do with these?,Chandler Bing,9,15,6,15
"Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.",Monica Geller,9,15,6,16
"Well, first of all, they're not called ""sneakers"" anymore. Apparently, they're called ""kicks"" or ""skids"" and I think I heard somebody say ""slorps"". And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! Would you help me try to sell these?",Chandler Bing,9,15,6,17
"Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?",Monica Geller,9,15,6,18
"No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.",Chandler Bing,9,15,6,19
"Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?",Joey Tribbiani,9,15,6,20
"Hey, you'll never guess what just happened... Phoebe and I got mugged!",Ross Geller,9,15,7,2
You okay?!,Monica Geller,9,15,7,3
"Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger!",Ross Geller,9,15,7,4
How do you know a mugger?,Monica Geller,9,15,7,5
I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us.,Phoebe Buffay,9,15,7,6
You wanna know how she knew him? Because Phoebe used to mug people.,Ross Geller,9,15,7,7
Seriously?,Monica Geller,9,15,7,8
"Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know... sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I.",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,7,9
"Phoebe, that is awful!",Monica Geller,9,15,7,10
"Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony... I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer.",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,7,11
You're mother killed herself!,Monica Geller,9,15,7,12
She was a drug dealer!,Phoebe Buffay,9,15,7,13
"Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because I was about to do some serious damage!",Ross Geller,9,15,7,14
Okay.,Phoebe Buffay,9,15,7,15
"Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.",Monica Geller,9,15,7,16
Why?,Phoebe Buffay,9,15,7,17
"Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.",Monica Geller,9,15,7,18
You were?,Phoebe Buffay,9,15,7,19
"Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics... you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-",Ross Geller,9,15,7,20
Wonderwoman!,Monica Geller,9,15,7,21
"Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone... ... when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: ""Gimme your money, punk!""",Ross Geller,9,15,7,22
Oh my god.,Phoebe Buffay,9,15,7,23
"I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: ""Science Boy""",Ross Geller,9,15,7,24
Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?,Monica Geller,9,15,7,25
A superhuman thirst for knowledge.,Ross Geller,9,15,7,26
That's it.,Monica Geller,9,15,7,27
"Well, I-I better get to class Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?",Ross Geller,9,15,7,28
"No... actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street... that's where stabby Joe works.",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,7,29
"Okay, I think we have a problem here.",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,7,30
What?,Monica Geller,9,15,7,31
"Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics.",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,7,32
Yeah?,Monica Geller,9,15,7,33
"Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat.",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,7,34
So?,Monica Geller,9,15,7,35
"Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,7,36
Oh my god!,Monica Geller,9,15,7,38

"Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go.",Joey Tribbiani,9,15,8,20
Hey!,Monica Geller,9,15,9,1
Hey!,Chandler Bing,9,15,9,2
What are you doing?,Monica Geller,9,15,9,3
"Putting on the sneakers... thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything.",Chandler Bing,9,15,9,4
"Oh, anything yet?",Rachel Green,9,15,9,5
"Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!",Chandler Bing,9,15,9,6
Hey!,Joey Tribbiani,9,15,9,7
Probably wanna know what I'm doing...?,Joey Tribbiani,9,15,9,9
"No, that seems about right.",Monica Geller,9,15,9,10
"Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!",Joey Tribbiani,9,15,9,11
"Joey, that was formula.",Rachel Green,9,15,9,12
We gotta get more of that.,Joey Tribbiani,9,15,9,13
You know what... these aren't half-bad! You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.,Chandler Bing,9,15,9,14
"Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.",Rachel Green,9,15,9,15
Alright I feel youger already!,Chandler Bing,9,15,9,16
"Yah, I think I broke my hip.",Chandler Bing,9,15,9,17
"Hey, you!",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,10,1
Hey!,Ross Geller,9,15,10,2
"Hey, how was class?",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,10,3
"No one ever asked me that, what's wrong?",Ross Geller,9,15,10,4
"Nothing, I really wanna know.",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,10,5
"Oh... Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene.",Ross Geller,9,15,10,6
"Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make... uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid.",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,10,7
Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.,Ross Geller,9,15,10,8
"You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,10,9
"No, it wasn't.",Ross Geller,9,15,10,10
"Yes, it was.",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,10,11
"No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old.",Ross Geller,9,15,10,12
"""Gimme your money, punk!""",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,10,13
"Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you... you mugged me?",Ross Geller,9,15,10,14
"Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat. I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have... have a great one!",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,10,15
It's not the best!,Ross Geller,9,15,10,16
"I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say.",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,10,17
There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.,Ross Geller,9,15,10,18
Really? Even more humiliating than.,Phoebe Buffay,9,15,10,19
"Hey, let's not do this!",Ross Geller,9,15,10,20
Okay... You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age.,Chandler Bing,9,15,11,3
"A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know... maybe he falls... maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: ""Not suitable for adults!""",Chandler Bing,9,15,11,5
"Oh, thank you, sir... or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me.",Chandler Bing,9,15,11,7
"I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.",Chandler Bing,9,15,11,9
The cold weather hurts my hip!,Chandler Bing,9,15,11,12
"Hey, Ross! I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,12,1
"Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.",Ross Geller,9,15,12,2
I just really wanted to apologize again and... and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.,Phoebe Buffay,9,15,12,3
"Oh my god, crap from the street?",Ross Geller,9,15,12,4
"Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell... or smoke. Anyway, I was looking through it and I found ""Science Boy""",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,12,5
Oh my god. I never thought I'd see this again. It's all here. What made you save it all these years?,Ross Geller,9,15,12,6
"I can't say, I just thought it was really good... and... maybe would be worth something some day.",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,12,7
"You really thought ""Science Boy"" was worth saving!",Ross Geller,9,15,12,8
"Yeah... but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,12,9
"Still... this is amazing... Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe.",Ross Geller,9,15,12,10
"You're welcome. And thank you for ""Science Boy"". I learned a lot from him.",Phoebe Buffay,9,15,12,11
You're welcome.,Ross Geller,9,15,12,12

"Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that.",Ross Geller,9,15,14,2

I see. You didn't happen to tell.,Ross Geller,9,15,14,4
... everybody we know? Yeah.,Monica Geller,9,15,14,5
Great. Thanks!,Ross Geller,9,15,14,6
Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?,Chandler Bing,9,16,1,1
I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?,Monica Geller,9,16,1,2
"I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.",Chandler Bing,9,16,1,3
"I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.",Monica Geller,9,16,1,4
Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.,Chandler Bing,9,16,1,5
"Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.",Monica Geller,9,16,1,6
You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?,Chandler Bing,9,16,1,7
Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.,Monica Geller,9,16,1,8
No! We're not borrowing money.,Chandler Bing,9,16,1,9
Why not?,Monica Geller,9,16,1,10
Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.,Chandler Bing,9,16,1,11
Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.,Monica Geller,9,16,1,12
That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.,Chandler Bing,9,16,1,13

"I've always wanted to live with a guy. ""Pick up your socks!"" ""Put down the toilet seat!"" ""No! We're not having sex anymore!"" It's gonna be fun!",Phoebe Buffay,9,16,2,18

Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.,Monica Geller,9,16,3,5

"Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like.. ""Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!"" or er.. ""Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!"" Huh!",Joey Tribbiani,9,16,3,19
"Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?",Monica Geller,9,16,3,20

But it's just...,Phoebe Buffay,9,16,7,14
Oh!,Phoebe Buffay,9,16,7,16

"I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.",Chandler Bing,9,16,8,16
Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.,Rachel Green,9,16,8,17

"I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?",Rachel Green,9,16,8,19
Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.,Monica Geller,9,16,8,20
No you really think that's what it is?,Rachel Green,9,16,8,21
"You heard him! ""No bigger!"" ""You're perfect!"" ""Just don't get any bigger!"" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.",Monica Geller,9,16,8,22

"Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.",Ross Geller,9,16,9,12
That's not how you really feel is it?,Phoebe Buffay,9,16,9,13

Seriously? You divorce-o?,Phoebe Buffay,9,16,9,15
"If you have to call me name, I prefer ""Ross the Divorcer"". It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.",Ross Geller,9,16,9,16
It's ok that's how you feel.,Phoebe Buffay,9,16,9,17

I thought I was something that we both wanted!,Monica Geller,9,16,11,15
"Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?",Chandler Bing,9,16,11,16
"Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?",Rachel Green,9,16,11,17

"Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.",Phoebe Buffay,9,16,13,5

"Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.",Chandler Bing,9,16,13,13
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.,Ross Geller,9,16,13,14
"Hey uh, where do you guys want this?",Joey Tribbiani,9,16,13,15
"Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. I mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.",Rachel Green,9,16,13,16
Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? None at all?,Phoebe Buffay,9,16,13,17
Right. Except that I do want to get married.,Phoebe Buffay,9,16,13,19

Someday.,Phoebe Buffay,9,16,13,22
Aaaaand....... hernia.,Chandler Bing,9,16,13,23
I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.,Phoebe Buffay,9,16,13,24
"Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.",Phoebe Buffay,9,16,13,26
"But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.",Phoebe Buffay,9,16,13,28
Are you gonna change yours?,Phoebe Buffay,9,16,13,30

Chandler... hey... Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma?,Joey Tribbiani,9,17,2,4

"Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!",Joey Tribbiani,9,17,2,6

"Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth.",Chandler Bing,9,17,3,8
"Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.",Phoebe Buffay,9,17,3,9
"Ok, you got it!",Monica Geller,9,17,3,10
"Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.",Phoebe Buffay,9,17,3,11
Really? If that's what you want...,Monica Geller,9,17,3,12
That was a test and you just failed.,Phoebe Buffay,9,17,3,13
Damn it! Rookie mistake!,Monica Geller,9,17,3,14
I have sex with dinosaurs??,Ross Geller,9,17,3,15
I believe I read that somewhere!,Chandler Bing,9,17,3,16
"That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long... It's not funny!!",Ross Geller,9,17,3,17
I respectfully disagree.,Chandler Bing,9,17,3,18
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!,Ross Geller,9,17,3,19
Who cares? Nobody reads those things.,Chandler Bing,9,17,3,20
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.,Ross Geller,9,17,3,21
I don't have a page.,Chandler Bing,9,17,3,22
Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!,Ross Geller,9,17,3,23

": Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!",Rachel Green,9,17,4,2
"It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.",Joey Tribbiani,9,17,4,3

"Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.",Rachel Green,9,17,4,6
There you go sweetie... This isn't over.,Joey Tribbiani,9,17,4,7
"Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... ""gay as the day is long""?",Monica Geller,9,17,5,1
Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.,Chandler Bing,9,17,5,2
But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.,Monica Geller,9,17,5,3
Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.,Chandler Bing,9,17,5,4
"Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.",Monica Geller,9,17,5,5
"Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go .",Chandler Bing,9,17,5,6

"Oh, you'll see my friend.",Chandler Bing,9,17,5,8
I'm dead?,Ross Geller,9,17,5,9
And so young.,Chandler Bing,9,17,5,10
Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.,Ross Geller,9,17,5,11
"Well, how you died was funny.",Chandler Bing,9,17,5,12
"Oh please, hit by a blimp?",Ross Geller,9,17,5,13
It kills over one americans every year.,Chandler Bing,9,17,5,14
"Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.",Ross Geller,9,17,5,15
You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!,Chandler Bing,9,17,5,16
"You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.",Ross Geller,9,17,5,17
"God, I wish Mike were here.",Phoebe Buffay,9,17,6,1
Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?,Monica Geller,9,17,6,2
"What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!",Monica Geller,9,17,6,3
"I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.",Phoebe Buffay,9,17,6,4
"Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. Give me your phone.",Monica Geller,9,17,6,5
Here.,Phoebe Buffay,9,17,6,6
And now your cell.,Monica Geller,9,17,6,7

"Phoebe, where's your purse?",Monica Geller,9,17,6,13
"No, no! Give it to me!",Monica Geller,9,17,6,14
You can't have it.,Phoebe Buffay,9,17,6,15

"Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.",Rachel Green,9,17,7,2
"No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!",Joey Tribbiani,9,17,7,3
"Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.",Rachel Green,9,17,7,4
"No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.",Joey Tribbiani,9,17,7,5
"Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...",Rachel Green,9,17,7,6
Make the transfer!,Joey Tribbiani,9,17,7,7
Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?,Rachel Green,9,17,7,8
"Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.",Joey Tribbiani,9,17,7,9
"Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.",Rachel Green,9,17,7,10
But he's the same.,Joey Tribbiani,9,17,7,11
"Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.",Rachel Green,9,17,7,12
But he's the same.,Joey Tribbiani,9,17,7,13
"Joey, come on!",Rachel Green,9,17,7,14
He's the same! .,Joey Tribbiani,9,17,7,15
You're not the same!,Joey Tribbiani,9,17,7,16
Haha!,Monica Geller,9,17,8,1
"You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.",Phoebe Buffay,9,17,8,2
"So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.",Monica Geller,9,17,8,3
Those are my shoes.,Phoebe Buffay,9,17,8,4
"Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.",Monica Geller,9,17,8,5
"Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.",Phoebe Buffay,9,17,8,6
Who's that?,Monica Geller,9,17,8,7

What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?,Phoebe Buffay,9,17,8,9
What are you doing here?,Monica Geller,9,17,8,10

"I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him.",Phoebe Buffay,9,17,8,13
Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?,Monica Geller,9,17,8,14
There is a speakerphone on the base unit...,Phoebe Buffay,9,17,8,15
Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!,Monica Geller,9,17,8,16
This doesn't concern you!!,Monica Geller,9,17,8,18
"Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.",Monica Geller,9,17,8,20
Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?,Phoebe Buffay,9,17,8,21
"Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend and Mike's friend .",Monica Geller,9,17,8,22
Sit down.,Phoebe Buffay,9,17,8,23

I've missed you too.,Phoebe Buffay,9,17,8,32
"You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!",Monica Geller,9,17,8,33
"Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?",Chandler Bing,9,17,9,1
"uhu uhu, check this out.",Ross Geller,9,17,9,2
Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?,Chandler Bing,9,17,9,3
"Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little ""Ross is dead"" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?",Ross Geller,9,17,9,4
"No, come on, you know that's not true.",Chandler Bing,9,17,9,5
What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!,Ross Geller,9,17,9,6
"Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.",Chandler Bing,9,17,9,7
I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!,Ross Geller,9,17,9,8
"Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.",Chandler Bing,9,17,9,9
You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.,Ross Geller,9,17,9,10
"Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.",Chandler Bing,9,17,9,11
Exactly!!,Ross Geller,9,17,9,12
"Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?",Chandler Bing,9,17,9,13
No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!,Ross Geller,9,17,9,14
"Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !",Chandler Bing,9,17,9,15
"oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...",Ross Geller,9,17,9,16
"I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?",Rachel Green,9,17,10,1
Original or crappy?,Joey Tribbiani,9,17,10,2
Original.,Rachel Green,9,17,10,3
"No, sorry haven't seen him.",Joey Tribbiani,9,17,10,4
Then what's that big lump under your covers?,Rachel Green,9,17,10,5
"It's Monica, ok?",Joey Tribbiani,9,17,10,6
That's not Monica!,Rachel Green,9,17,10,7
"Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..",Joey Tribbiani,9,17,10,8
Oh God.,Rachel Green,9,17,10,9
... she's being unreasonable!,Joey Tribbiani,9,17,10,10
"Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much Oh don't cover its ears! It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!",Rachel Green,9,17,10,11
It does?,Joey Tribbiani,9,17,10,12

"It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!",Ross Geller,9,17,12,23
"You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!",Chandler Bing,9,17,12,24
"Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?",Ross Geller,9,17,12,25
"Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?",Chandler Bing,9,17,12,26

"Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!",Chandler Bing,9,17,12,36
I didn't know Ross and you were so close.,Chandler Bing,9,17,12,38
"I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.",Chandler Bing,9,17,12,40
"But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!",Ross Geller,9,17,12,42
Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!,Ross Geller,9,17,12,44
"No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. Monica?",Ross Geller,9,17,13,1
"Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?",Joey Tribbiani,9,18,1,1

"Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!",Monica Geller,9,18,1,12
Uh!,Joey Tribbiani,9,18,1,13
"Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.",Monica Geller,9,18,1,14
"Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!",Chandler Bing,9,18,1,15
Hey will you get me tickets too?,Phoebe Buffay,9,18,1,16
"Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it! Everyone almost simultaneously except Ross: yeah thats a great idea!",Rachel Green,9,18,1,17
No thanks!,Ross Geller,9,18,1,18

Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.,Chandler Bing,9,18,1,25
I like those odds!,Joey Tribbiani,9,18,1,26
"Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.",Ross Geller,9,18,1,27
I'll ask. Boohaki?,Chandler Bing,9,18,1,28

"Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.",Rachel Green,9,18,1,30

"So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?",Monica Geller,9,18,2,16
"Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!",Ross Geller,9,18,2,17
"Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!!",Chandler Bing,9,18,2,18
Think he washed his hands?,Ross Geller,9,18,2,19
"Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?",Chandler Bing,9,18,2,20

"Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!",Phoebe Buffay,9,18,2,35
"Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.",Monica Geller,9,18,2,36
A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!,Ross Geller,9,18,2,37
"Alright, who wants to do it?",Monica Geller,9,18,2,38
"Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!",Phoebe Buffay,9,18,2,39
"Ok, hey Rach?",Monica Geller,9,18,2,40
"Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.",Rachel Green,9,18,2,41

I hope I win!,Phoebe Buffay,9,18,2,43
"Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?",Monica Geller,9,18,2,44

"Right! .. but we ""know"" what you're wishing for!",Monica Geller,9,18,2,46
Can't really say!,Joey Tribbiani,9,18,2,47
"I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?",Monica Geller,9,18,2,48
I'm not really comfortable with these questions!,Joey Tribbiani,9,18,2,49
"One, two, three!",Phoebe Buffay,9,18,2,51
"I won, hey!",Joey Tribbiani,9,18,2,52
"You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! Ah!! That thing gets hot!!",Ross Geller,9,18,2,53
"You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?",Rachel Green,9,18,2,54
"Uh, you're not gonna win.",Ross Geller,9,18,2,55
"Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we're gonna be all like ""oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape"" and you're gonna be all like ""oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai""",Rachel Green,9,18,2,56
"Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.",Ross Geller,9,18,2,57
"I can see the headline now: ""Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm"".",Chandler Bing,9,18,2,58
Why would I eat my own arm?,Ross Geller,9,18,2,59
"Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.",Chandler Bing,9,18,2,60
"You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.",Monica Geller,9,18,2,61
Why?,Ross Geller,9,18,2,62
"Because I know that you think the lottery is ""boohaki"" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.",Monica Geller,9,18,2,63
"You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here.",Ross Geller,9,18,2,64
Get a room!,Phoebe Buffay,9,18,2,65
"Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?",Chandler Bing,9,18,2,66
"I don't know, probably just invest it.",Ross Geller,9,18,2,67
Ooh! Calm down ...,Chandler Bing,9,18,2,68
"Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?",Joey Tribbiani,9,18,2,69
"Oh, I'm sorry, did I say ""invest it""? I meant ""be cool and piss it all away""",Ross Geller,9,18,2,70
"Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!",Joey Tribbiani,9,18,2,71
I don't really care about the Knicks.,Rachel Green,9,18,2,72
"Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.",Joey Tribbiani,9,18,2,73
You would do that? I never get picked!,Rachel Green,9,18,2,74
"You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.",Chandler Bing,9,18,2,75
You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!,Joey Tribbiani,9,18,2,76
"You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.",Chandler Bing,9,18,2,77
"Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?",Ross Geller,9,18,2,78
I'll take this one too Uh ... Mommy?,Chandler Bing,9,18,2,79
"Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel ""Mommy"" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...",Ross Geller,9,18,2,80
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.,Rachel Green,9,18,2,81
"Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me ""Daddy"" too.",Ross Geller,9,18,2,82
"Oooh, I like that, ""daddy""",Phoebe Buffay,9,18,2,83
I ... I was just talking about Rachel.,Ross Geller,9,18,2,84
"Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?",Phoebe Buffay,9,18,2,85
Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. no I can't.,Ross Geller,9,18,2,86
"Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye.",Chandler Bing,9,18,2,87
"Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?",Joey Tribbiani,9,18,2,88
"Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.",Chandler Bing,9,18,2,89
"Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!",Monica Geller,9,18,2,90
He's the boss's son.,Chandler Bing,9,18,2,91
"Come on, lottery!!",Monica Geller,9,18,2,92
"Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.",Rachel Green,9,18,2,93
"Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.",Monica Geller,9,18,2,94
"Ooh, I have another idea!",Rachel Green,9,18,2,95
"I'm sorry, idea time is over.",Monica Geller,9,18,2,96
"Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?",Phoebe Buffay,9,18,2,97
Yeah.,Monica Geller,9,18,2,98
What about the ones you have on the nightstand?,Chandler Bing,9,18,2,99
There are no tickets on the nightstand!,Monica Geller,9,18,2,100
"Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.",Chandler Bing,9,18,2,101
"Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!",Monica Geller,9,18,2,102
"Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!",Chandler Bing,9,18,2,103
"Chandler, sense the tone!!",Monica Geller,9,18,2,104
"Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!",Rachel Green,9,18,2,105
"Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.",Monica Geller,9,18,2,106
Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.,Phoebe Buffay,9,18,2,107
"I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!",Ross Geller,9,18,2,108
"Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!",Monica Geller,9,18,2,109
3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...,Ross Geller,9,18,2,110
"I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?",Joey Tribbiani,9,18,2,111
When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!,Monica Geller,9,18,2,112
I'll show you how.,Joey Tribbiani,9,18,2,113
"Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your ""special"" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?",Rachel Green,9,18,2,114
"Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!",Monica Geller,9,18,2,115
"Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?",Rachel Green,9,18,2,116
"She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...",Chandler Bing,9,18,2,117
Ahhh!,Monica Geller,9,18,2,118
"Let me finish ... however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!!",Chandler Bing,9,18,2,119
There's the man I married!!,Monica Geller,9,18,2,120
"All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!",Rachel Green,9,18,2,121
"Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!",Monica Geller,9,18,2,122
"OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets !",Rachel Green,9,18,2,123
"Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!",Joey Tribbiani,9,18,2,124
"Than I want mine, too ! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.",Ross Geller,9,18,2,125
"Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together.",Phoebe Buffay,9,18,2,126
"No, no! We should divide them up and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!",Monica Geller,9,18,2,127
"Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea!",Joey Tribbiani,9,18,2,128
"Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!",Chandler Bing,9,18,2,129
"Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up!",Rachel Green,9,18,2,130

"If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! .",Phoebe Buffay,9,18,2,137
Don't come any closer!,Phoebe Buffay,9,18,2,139
"Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...",Chandler Bing,9,18,2,140
"No, what's more important, your friends or money?",Phoebe Buffay,9,18,2,141
Money! Friends...,Monica Geller,9,18,2,143
"Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?",Phoebe Buffay,9,18,2,144
They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra ...,Monica Geller,9,18,2,145

"Ok, good! You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this... Oh God, no! I think I broke your bowl.",Phoebe Buffay,9,18,2,147
"Go, go, go!!",Ross Geller,9,18,2,148
"What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.",Phoebe Buffay,9,18,3,2
"Phoebe, we lost half of them.",Monica Geller,9,18,3,3
"So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?",Phoebe Buffay,9,18,3,4
Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...,Ross Geller,9,18,3,5
"As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die. So, excuse me for being a little skittish.",Phoebe Buffay,9,18,3,6
"Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!",Chandler Bing,9,18,3,7
"Oh, play them!",Monica Geller,9,18,3,8

"Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.",Phoebe Buffay,9,18,3,11
This is..shhh!,Chandler Bing,9,18,3,13
"Oh God, I am so sorry honey...",Monica Geller,9,18,3,15

"Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?",Chandler Bing,9,18,3,18
"No, she was just much better at job than me!",Rachel Green,9,18,3,19
"Guys, the drawing is about to start!",Phoebe Buffay,9,18,3,20
You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.,Rachel Green,9,18,3,21
"Oh yeah, it's a good idea!",Ross Geller,9,18,3,22
"Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.",Monica Geller,9,18,3,23
"Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?",Chandler Bing,9,18,3,24

"Oh, that's not cool.",Ross Geller,9,19,8,7
"No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt I wish I'd thought this through.",Ross Geller,9,19,8,9
"I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.",Chandler Bing,9,19,8,10

"Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.",Rachel Green,9,19,9,7
What do you think brought than on?,Monica Geller,9,19,9,8

A love scene? With who?,Monica Geller,9,19,9,10
Olivia.,Rachel Green,9,19,9,11
"Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! Oh right, real life more important.",Monica Geller,9,19,9,12
So do you think that my dream means anything?,Rachel Green,9,19,9,13
"I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.",Monica Geller,9,19,9,14
Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...,Rachel Green,9,19,9,15
"Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.",Monica Geller,9,19,9,16
You took the same class twice.,Rachel Green,9,19,9,17
It was hard! Phoebe: Hey!,Monica Geller,9,19,9,18

"Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.",Monica Geller,9,19,9,21
"Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.",Phoebe Buffay,9,19,9,22
"Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.",Monica Geller,9,19,9,23
"Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back . Rachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...",Phoebe Buffay,9,19,9,24
My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?,Phoebe Buffay,9,19,9,25
"Ok, we're still on that.",Rachel Green,9,19,9,26
I didn't say your songs were not good enough.,Monica Geller,9,19,9,27
Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?,Phoebe Buffay,9,19,9,28
Tiny portions?,Monica Geller,9,19,9,29
"Yeah well, ""excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but I can't see it, I can't see it""!",Phoebe Buffay,9,19,9,30
"Phoebe, it's not about quantity.",Monica Geller,9,19,9,31
Well...it's not about quality.,Phoebe Buffay,9,19,9,32
"Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.",Monica Geller,9,19,9,33
"Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.",Phoebe Buffay,9,19,9,34
"Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.",Monica Geller,9,19,9,35
"Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?",Phoebe Buffay,9,19,9,36
"You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.",Monica Geller,9,19,9,37
"What are people having, the garlic Martini?",Phoebe Buffay,9,19,9,38
"Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps. Chandler: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.",Chandler Bing,9,19,10,2
"Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game. Ross: Oh my god.",Ross Geller,9,19,10,3
What?,Chandler Bing,9,19,10,4
There's something new in the bowl.,Ross Geller,9,19,10,5
"Look, we have enough, just walk away.",Chandler Bing,9,19,10,6
"No, but I want...I want the pinecones!",Ross Geller,9,19,10,7
There's a forest right outside.,Chandler Bing,9,19,10,8
It's not the same.,Ross Geller,9,19,10,9
"Ok, go quick! Ross: Thank you for a delightful stay. Ross: Oh, my maple candy!",Chandler Bing,9,19,10,10
"Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you.. Monica: Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.",Phoebe Buffay,9,19,11,1
"You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.",Phoebe Buffay,9,19,11,2
"Ok, you have to stop playing now.",Monica Geller,9,19,11,3
Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!,Phoebe Buffay,9,19,11,4
"Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!",Monica Geller,9,19,11,5
Get your garlic-peelers off me!,Phoebe Buffay,9,19,11,6
"Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. .. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside?",Monica Geller,9,19,11,7
"Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? Ha!",Phoebe Buffay,9,19,11,8
"Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .",Monica Geller,9,19,11,9
"Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?",Phoebe Buffay,9,19,11,10
Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?,Monica Geller,9,19,11,11
"Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .",Phoebe Buffay,9,19,11,12
Excuse us! Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now?,Monica Geller,9,19,11,13
Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great!,Phoebe Buffay,9,19,11,14
I'm sorry...,Monica Geller,9,19,11,15
I'm sorry too...,Phoebe Buffay,9,19,11,16
ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?,Monica Geller,9,19,11,17
Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p... Phoebe: Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?,Phoebe Buffay,9,19,11,18

"Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!",Rachel Green,9,21,2,18
"Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.",Phoebe Buffay,9,21,2,19

Wow. What does that mean?,Ross Geller,9,21,9,10

Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?,Ross Geller,9,21,9,12

"Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?",Phoebe Buffay,9,21,11,5

"Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!",Rachel Green,9,21,11,14
Tips not included.,Phoebe Buffay,9,21,11,15
"Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?",Rachel Green,9,21,11,16
"Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!",Phoebe Buffay,9,21,11,17

What?,Ross Geller,9,21,12,14
"What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.",Ross Geller,9,21,12,16
"Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.",Ross Geller,9,21,12,18
"And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.",Ross Geller,9,21,12,20
That was going to be my next argument.,Ross Geller,9,21,12,22
Hey!,Joey Tribbiani,9,21,12,23

"Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.",Ross Geller,9,22,2,12
"Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.",Ross Geller,9,22,2,14
"Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?",Rachel Green,9,22,2,15
Tsz... NO! .,Ross Geller,9,22,2,16
Hey guys!,Chandler Bing,9,22,2,17
"Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.",Ross Geller,9,22,2,18
"I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.",Chandler Bing,9,22,2,19
It's in Barbados.,Ross Geller,9,22,2,20
But you come first!,Chandler Bing,9,22,2,21

"Bye, see ya.",Rachel Green,9,22,2,25
Ok.,Chandler Bing,9,22,2,26
"All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?",Joey Tribbiani,9,22,2,27
Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.,Chandler Bing,9,22,2,28
So-so what did the doctor say?,Ross Geller,9,22,2,29
"Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.",Chandler Bing,9,22,2,30
So you're ruling out surrogacy?,Joey Tribbiani,9,22,2,31
Yeah.,Chandler Bing,9,22,2,32
"So, I don't have to learn what that means?",Joey Tribbiani,9,22,2,33
"Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.",Chandler Bing,9,22,2,34
"Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?",Joey Tribbiani,9,22,2,35
ah-ha!,Chandler Bing,9,22,2,36
How do you feel about all this?,Ross Geller,9,22,2,37
I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.,Chandler Bing,9,22,2,38
"Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!",Joey Tribbiani,9,22,2,39
What?,Ross Geller,9,22,2,40
What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!,Ross Geller,9,22,2,41
The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.,Ross Geller,9,22,3,1
"I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. So-so what I am saying is - is is that is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!",Ross Geller,9,22,3,3
"Oh, that's not what you want...",Ross Geller,9,22,3,4
"Oh, I'll take some of that.",Phoebe Buffay,9,22,4,2
"Pheebs, that's for men!",Rachel Green,9,22,4,3
"No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. Yeah.",Phoebe Buffay,9,22,4,4
"Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. . Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!",Phoebe Buffay,9,22,4,5
"On Melanie Griffith in ""Working girl"". I think what you want is over here.",Rachel Green,9,22,4,7
Really?,Rachel Green,9,22,4,9
"Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.",Rachel Green,9,22,4,11
"Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!",Rachel Green,9,22,4,13
"Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?",Phoebe Buffay,9,22,4,14
Sure!,Rachel Green,9,22,4,15
Ok!,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,4,16
You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.,Rachel Green,9,22,4,18
"So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?",Phoebe Buffay,9,22,4,19
"She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!",Rachel Green,9,22,4,20
Why?,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,4,21
"I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!",Rachel Green,9,22,4,22
Who else?,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,4,23
"Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...",Rachel Green,9,22,4,24
You like Joey?,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,4,25
"Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.",Rachel Green,9,22,4,26
Oh my God!,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,4,27
"It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!",Rachel Green,9,22,4,28
"Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?",Phoebe Buffay,9,22,4,29
"Oh, I get it!",Rachel Green,9,22,4,30
"Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.",Phoebe Buffay,9,22,4,31
"I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.",Rachel Green,9,22,4,32
Yeah.,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,4,33
So can we keep this between us?,Rachel Green,9,22,4,34
Sure!,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,4,35
"Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!",Rachel Green,9,22,4,36
Oh.,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,4,37
Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,4,38
Hi honey!,Monica Geller,9,22,5,1
"Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!",Chandler Bing,9,22,5,2
"Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!",Monica Geller,9,22,5,3
"You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.",Chandler Bing,9,22,5,5
I got it.,Monica Geller,9,22,5,6
"So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?",Chandler Bing,9,22,5,8
"Yeah, I guess.",Monica Geller,9,22,5,9
"So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!",Chandler Bing,9,22,5,10
Excuse me?,Monica Geller,9,22,5,11
"Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is ""spermtastic""!",Chandler Bing,9,22,5,12
"Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! ""Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm""!",Monica Geller,9,22,5,13
"No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.",Chandler Bing,9,22,5,14
Chandler!,Monica Geller,9,22,5,15
"I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!",Chandler Bing,9,22,5,16
I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!,Monica Geller,9,22,5,17
Ok!,Chandler Bing,9,22,5,18
Uh!,Monica Geller,9,22,5,19
Zack!,Chandler Bing,9,22,5,20
"Tell me about yourself, Zack!",Monica Geller,9,22,5,22
"Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!",Rachel Green,9,22,6,1
"Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.",Phoebe Buffay,9,22,6,2
"Ok, great!",Rachel Green,9,22,6,3
"Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!",Rachel Green,9,22,6,4
I didn't say anything yet!,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,6,5
"Well, get back in there and talk!",Rachel Green,9,22,6,6
I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,6,7
What!?,Rachel Green,9,22,6,8
"Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.",Phoebe Buffay,9,22,6,9
"Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!",Rachel Green,9,22,6,10
Ooh! We have a problem.,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,6,11
Oh! What are we gonna do?,Rachel Green,9,22,6,12
Oh my God!,Rachel Green,9,22,6,14
Alright! Enough out of you!,Rachel Green,9,22,6,16

I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...,Ross Geller,9,22,7,4
Oh! How's it going?,Joey Tribbiani,9,22,7,5
"It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!",Ross Geller,9,22,7,6
What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!,Joey Tribbiani,9,22,7,7
Barbados.,Ross Geller,9,22,7,8
"Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!",Joey Tribbiani,9,22,7,9
What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.,Ross Geller,9,22,7,10
"Well, just wake him up!",Joey Tribbiani,9,22,7,11
"I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!",Ross Geller,9,22,7,12
"Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?",Joey Tribbiani,9,22,7,13

"Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!",Monica Geller,9,22,8,4
You don't like him.,Chandler Bing,9,22,8,5
I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.,Monica Geller,9,22,8,6
Alright! Just follow my lead!,Chandler Bing,9,22,8,7
"Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?",Chandler Bing,9,22,8,9
That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.,Chandler Bing,9,22,8,11
"Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?",Monica Geller,9,22,8,13
"Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?",Monica Geller,9,22,8,15
We're just making conversation.,Monica Geller,9,22,8,17
You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness.,Chandler Bing,9,22,8,19
I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?,Chandler Bing,9,22,8,23
Yess!!,Monica Geller,9,22,8,25
We're teeth people Zack!,Chandler Bing,9,22,8,26
Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.,Rachel Green,9,22,9,1
Good plan.,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,9,2
Ok. Wha...? where? Where are you going?,Rachel Green,9,22,9,3
"Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at ""who's more over who""!",Phoebe Buffay,9,22,9,4
"Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?",Rachel Green,9,22,9,5
"Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!",Rachel Green,9,22,9,7
"Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.",Rachel Green,9,22,9,9

Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you!,Ross Geller,9,22,10,2
Wow! You look... ... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!,Joey Tribbiani,9,22,11,2
Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,11,3
Then don't go!,Joey Tribbiani,9,22,11,4
"Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.",Phoebe Buffay,9,22,11,5
"Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!",Joey Tribbiani,9,22,11,6
"You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.",Phoebe Buffay,9,22,11,7
David?,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,12,1
Oh my God!,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,12,3

Good!,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,12,13
"Oh, good for you.",Phoebe Buffay,9,22,12,15
Mike and I broke up.,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,12,17
Really?,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,12,19
"I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!",Phoebe Buffay,9,22,12,21
Well... no.,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,12,23
I'd love to.,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,12,25
Ok.,Phoebe Buffay,9,22,12,27
"Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.",Phoebe Buffay,9,22,12,29
"No, that's David.",Rachel Green,9,22,12,31
Tip of the iceberg.,Rachel Green,9,22,12,33
You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?,Chandler Bing,9,22,12,35
"Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.",Chandler Bing,9,22,12,37
Ok.,Chandler Bing,9,22,12,39
I think we've found our sperm!,Chandler Bing,9,22,12,40
Does seem pretty perfect.,Monica Geller,9,22,12,41
"Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?",Chandler Bing,9,22,12,42
No.,Monica Geller,9,22,12,43
"Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!",Chandler Bing,9,22,12,44
"No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.",Monica Geller,9,22,12,45
"Yeah, he's better!",Chandler Bing,9,22,12,46
"No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.",Monica Geller,9,22,12,47
Really? Are you sure?,Chandler Bing,9,22,12,48
"Yeah, I'm sure.",Monica Geller,9,22,12,49
"Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.",Chandler Bing,9,22,12,50
That is so sweet. I love you.,Monica Geller,9,22,12,51
So you know this leaves us with...,Chandler Bing,9,22,12,52
Adoption.,Monica Geller,9,22,12,53
How do you feel about that?,Chandler Bing,9,22,12,54
I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.,Monica Geller,9,22,12,55
Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.,Chandler Bing,9,22,12,56
"So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?",Monica Geller,9,22,12,57

"Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!",Chandler Bing,9,22,12,62
"Hey, Zack!",Chandler Bing,9,22,12,64
"Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.",Chandler Bing,9,22,12,66
Really?,Chandler Bing,9,22,12,68
"My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.",Chandler Bing,9,22,12,70
"You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?",Chandler Bing,9,22,12,73
Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!,Joey Tribbiani,9,23,1,1
"Oh, that's right! Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?",Ross Geller,9,23,1,2
Mmh-mmh.,Joey Tribbiani,9,23,1,3
Can you say Barbados?,Ross Geller,9,23,1,4
Barbados!,Joey Tribbiani,9,23,1,5
"Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right! This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.",Ross Geller,9,23,1,6
Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?,Rachel Green,9,23,1,7
"Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, ""island's stuff"".",Chandler Bing,9,23,1,8
I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.,Phoebe Buffay,9,23,1,9
"Oh, right, because he's a scientist!",Ross Geller,9,23,1,10
"No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.",Phoebe Buffay,9,23,1,11
"Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.",Ross Geller,9,23,1,12
"All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.",Joey Tribbiani,9,23,1,13
"It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!",Ross Geller,9,23,1,14
Look at all these paleontologists!!,Ross Geller,9,23,1,17
"I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow!",Joey Tribbiani,9,23,1,18
"I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!",Joey Tribbiani,9,23,1,20
That... never happens...,Joey Tribbiani,9,23,1,22

"No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called ""The Days of Our Lives"".",Joey Tribbiani,9,23,1,32
"Dude, it's just ""Days of Our Lives""... there's no the.",Ross Geller,9,23,1,33
"Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.",Joey Tribbiani,9,23,1,34

"David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.",Monica Geller,9,23,2,1
See?,Monica Geller,9,23,2,3
"Yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind"".",Chandler Bing,9,23,2,4
"Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.",Monica Geller,9,23,2,5
"Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.",Phoebe Buffay,9,23,2,6

"That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!",Phoebe Buffay,9,23,2,9
"Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!",Phoebe Buffay,9,23,2,11
She does?,Chandler Bing,9,23,2,12
Let's get you out of here!!,Monica Geller,9,23,2,13
At least you took me down with you!,Monica Geller,9,23,2,14
"I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?",Phoebe Buffay,9,23,2,15
"I guess, in time.",Monica Geller,9,23,2,16
Yeah.,Phoebe Buffay,9,23,2,17
"I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.",Monica Geller,9,23,2,18
"You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!",Phoebe Buffay,9,23,2,19
I wouldn't read too much into it.,Chandler Bing,9,23,3,2
"David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.",Chandler Bing,9,23,3,4
"Seriously, we're gonna do this?",Chandler Bing,9,23,3,6
"Oh, because his penis was too big. Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?",Chandler Bing,9,23,3,8
What?,Chandler Bing,9,23,3,10
I didn't mean now...,Chandler Bing,9,23,3,12

Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!,Joey Tribbiani,9,23,4,2
"Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?",Joey Tribbiani,9,23,4,3
You really should have been more clear about that!,Joey Tribbiani,9,23,4,5
Hey!,Ross Geller,9,23,4,6

You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!,Ross Geller,9,23,4,8
Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?,Joey Tribbiani,9,23,4,9
"Yeah, she never misses these conferences! No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!",Ross Geller,9,23,4,10
Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?,Ross Geller,9,23,4,12
"You could say: ""Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?""",Joey Tribbiani,9,23,4,13
Ready to go?,Ross Geller,9,23,4,14
Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?,Joey Tribbiani,9,23,4,16

Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!,Joey Tribbiani,9,23,4,22
"I'm good, I have dinner plans .",Ross Geller,9,23,4,23
"Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...",Joey Tribbiani,9,23,4,25
"Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?",Ross Geller,9,23,4,26

Oh man!,Joey Tribbiani,9,23,4,28
"I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole!",Joey Tribbiani,9,23,4,30
Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.,Monica Geller,9,23,5,1
"I do! Want a hint? huh? ""I do"" ""I do"".",Chandler Bing,9,23,5,2
"Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.",Monica Geller,9,23,5,3
David is going to propose to Phoebe.,Chandler Bing,9,23,5,4
What? Why?,Monica Geller,9,23,5,5
"Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.",Chandler Bing,9,23,5,6
"Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?",Monica Geller,9,23,5,7
"I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?",Chandler Bing,9,23,5,8
"They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say ""No"", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.",Monica Geller,9,23,5,9
"Man, that's some bad advice!",Chandler Bing,9,23,5,10
Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!,Joey Tribbiani,9,23,6,2

"Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!",Monica Geller,9,23,6,6

"Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in.",Joey Tribbiani,9,23,6,8
"Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!",Monica Geller,9,23,6,9
"Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!",Phoebe Buffay,9,23,6,10
And make sure our room isn't next to theirs .,Monica Geller,9,23,6,11

"Are you leaving ""The Supremes""?",Phoebe Buffay,9,23,6,28
"Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.",Monica Geller,9,23,6,29
Wow? Really? That's fantastic!,Phoebe Buffay,9,23,6,30
What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?,Monica Geller,9,23,6,31
"Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it: ""Mike, do you take Phoebe..."" You know, it's every girl's dream!",Phoebe Buffay,9,23,6,32
Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?,Monica Geller,9,23,6,33
"Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!",Phoebe Buffay,9,23,6,34
"By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.",Ross Geller,9,23,7,1

"Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!",Chandler Bing,9,23,7,16
Wha... what do you mean?,Ross Geller,9,23,7,17
It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.,Chandler Bing,9,23,7,18
"What, oh my God. What did you do?",Ross Geller,9,23,7,19
Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.,Chandler Bing,9,23,7,20
"Why, why would you open it?",Ross Geller,9,23,7,21
"Well, it didn't say ""This is a virus""!!",Chandler Bing,9,23,7,22

Ugh.,Rachel Green,9,23,7,45
"Alright, ok, let's do it. Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.",Ross Geller,9,23,7,46
"Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a ""Galaxy far, far away""? .",Joey Tribbiani,9,23,7,47
"Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole ""I never want to get married"" thing and step up!",Monica Geller,9,23,8,2
"This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say ""yes"" but I know she really wants to be with you!",Monica Geller,9,23,8,4
"I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair!",Monica Geller,9,23,8,6
"You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? Damnit!",Monica Geller,9,23,8,8
"Well, I hope you're happy!",Monica Geller,9,23,8,9

"No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.",Monica Geller,9,23,8,15
Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!,Chandler Bing,9,23,8,16
"Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!",Monica Geller,9,23,8,17
This vacation sucks!!,Chandler Bing,9,23,8,18

"Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.",Monica Geller,9,23,12,5

"I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.",Chandler Bing,9,23,12,30
No!,Phoebe Buffay,9,23,12,32
"I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.",Phoebe Buffay,9,23,12,34
"David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.",Phoebe Buffay,9,23,12,37

"Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!",Rachel Green,9,24,2,2
"Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...",Ross Geller,9,24,2,3
Not to mention the cold sores.,Chandler Bing,9,24,2,4
"And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.",Ross Geller,9,24,2,5
Really?,Chandler Bing,9,24,2,6
"But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...",Ross Geller,9,24,2,7
"He said ""erectus""!",Joey Tribbiani,9,24,2,9

I'm not always that bad!,Monica Geller,9,24,4,9
"Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?",Chandler Bing,9,24,4,10

"Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!",Rachel Green,10,1,1,103
Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?,Phoebe Buffay,10,1,1,104
"Well, he's with Charlie now.",Joey Tribbiani,10,1,1,105

"You're a pain in my ass, Geller!",Joey Tribbiani,10,1,1,107
"All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...",Rachel Green,10,1,1,108

Are you serious?,Ross Geller,10,1,3,53
Yeah... Now I have something...,Joey Tribbiani,10,1,3,54

Dude!,Joey Tribbiani,10,1,3,60
"Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...",Ross Geller,10,1,3,61

Really? Excited?,Rachel Green,10,1,3,75
Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...,Ross Geller,10,1,3,76
"Excuse me! You didn't tell him, did you?",Rachel Green,10,1,3,77
I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.,Joey Tribbiani,10,1,3,78
"Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.",Rachel Green,10,1,3,79
"Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.",Joey Tribbiani,10,1,3,80
"Hi, Mike's place.",Phoebe Buffay,10,1,4,1
"Ooh, that was fast.",Phoebe Buffay,10,1,4,3
"Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.",Phoebe Buffay,10,1,4,5
Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?,Phoebe Buffay,10,1,4,7
"Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout.",Phoebe Buffay,10,1,4,9
I... I'm Phoebe.,Phoebe Buffay,10,1,4,11
Enchante.,Phoebe Buffay,10,1,4,13
"Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... Ow!",Monica Geller,10,1,5,1
"You go back to work tomorrow night, right?",Chandler Bing,10,1,5,2
Yeah!,Monica Geller,10,1,5,3
"So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?",Chandler Bing,10,1,5,4
"Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. You like that, right?",Monica Geller,10,1,5,5
What are you singing?,Chandler Bing,10,1,5,6
"It's ""Bolero"" from ""10"".",Monica Geller,10,1,5,7
"It's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" from ""Apocalypse Now""... See, Here's The Thing The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!",Chandler Bing,10,1,5,8
You what? You said you liked them.,Monica Geller,10,1,5,9
Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.,Chandler Bing,10,1,5,10
"Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.",Monica Geller,10,1,5,11
"Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.",Chandler Bing,10,1,5,12
"You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... OUCH!",Monica Geller,10,1,5,13
Hit yourself in the tooth?,Chandler Bing,10,1,5,14
And the eye!,Monica Geller,10,1,5,15
"Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you. Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle?",Ross Geller,10,1,6,1
"That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.",Rachel Green,10,1,6,2
"Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.",Ross Geller,10,1,6,3
"Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.",Rachel Green,10,1,6,4
"Okay, shoot!",Ross Geller,10,1,6,5
"Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.",Rachel Green,10,1,6,6
OH NO!,Ross Geller,10,1,6,7
What? What is it?,Rachel Green,10,1,6,8
"Oh, major shampoo explosion!",Ross Geller,10,1,6,9
"Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.",Rachel Green,10,1,6,10
"Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me?",Ross Geller,10,1,6,11
Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?,Rachel Green,10,1,6,12
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?",Ross Geller,10,1,6,13
"Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...",Rachel Green,10,1,6,14
"Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?",Ross Geller,10,1,6,15
"Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.",Rachel Green,10,1,6,16
"Duh, you think?",Ross Geller,10,1,6,17
"Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.",Phoebe Buffay,10,1,7,1
"Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?",Phoebe Buffay,10,1,7,3
"Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.",Phoebe Buffay,10,1,7,5
"Well, I don't...",Phoebe Buffay,10,1,7,7
"Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.",Phoebe Buffay,10,1,7,9
"Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.",Phoebe Buffay,10,1,7,11
"Okay, not a fan of the tough love.",Phoebe Buffay,10,1,7,12
"But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...",Phoebe Buffay,10,1,7,14
"Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.",Phoebe Buffay,10,1,7,16
You're welcome!,Phoebe Buffay,10,1,7,19
"Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?",Chandler Bing,10,1,8,1
Not really.,Monica Geller,10,1,8,2
I have a problem.,Monica Geller,10,1,8,3
Really? What happened?,Chandler Bing,10,1,8,4
"Well, I was dancing around, and singing ""No Woman, No Cry"" and I got stuck.",Monica Geller,10,1,8,5
You can't move at all?,Chandler Bing,10,1,8,6
"Oh, well, I can move...",Monica Geller,10,1,8,7
"If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?",Chandler Bing,10,1,8,8
I guess so...,Monica Geller,10,1,8,9
Some of these look a little frayed.,Chandler Bing,10,1,8,10
"Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.",Monica Geller,10,1,8,11
Hey!,Joey Tribbiani,10,1,9,1
Hi!,Rachel Green,10,1,9,2
"So, did you err... did you tell Ross?",Joey Tribbiani,10,1,9,3
"Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.",Rachel Green,10,1,9,4
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory.",Joey Tribbiani,10,1,9,5
"Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.",Rachel Green,10,1,9,6
"Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.",Joey Tribbiani,10,1,9,7
"Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...",Rachel Green,10,1,9,8
"I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.",Joey Tribbiani,10,1,9,9
"No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?",Rachel Green,10,1,9,10
Yeah! Good night!,Joey Tribbiani,10,1,9,11
Goo--ood night!,Rachel Green,10,1,9,12
Good night!,Joey Tribbiani,10,1,9,13

Stop saying good night.,Joey Tribbiani,10,1,9,15
Okay.,Rachel Green,10,1,9,16
Look what I found in the drawer... And you said I'd never wear this...,Monica Geller,10,1,10,1
"Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?",Chandler Bing,10,1,10,2
"Sure, what do you have in mind?",Monica Geller,10,1,10,3
I think you know.,Chandler Bing,10,1,10,4
Really? I don't really feel like it.,Monica Geller,10,1,10,5
This is what I want to do.,Chandler Bing,10,1,10,6
"Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.",Monica Geller,10,1,10,7
"She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.",Chandler Bing,10,1,10,8
"Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?",Joey Tribbiani,10,2,1,1
We weren't doing anything!,Rachel Green,10,2,1,2
"Rach, he just saw us.",Joey Tribbiani,10,2,1,3
Shhh.,Rachel Green,10,2,1,4
"But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.",Joey Tribbiani,10,2,1,5
"No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.",Rachel Green,10,2,1,6
"Dude, chill! Okay, we also kissed in Barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie.",Joey Tribbiani,10,2,1,7
"Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.",Rachel Green,10,2,1,8
"Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..",Joey Tribbiani,10,2,1,9
"We feel so terrible about this, Ross.",Rachel Green,10,2,1,10
"Yeah, but it did happen, so...",Joey Tribbiani,10,2,1,11
Ross?,Joey Tribbiani,10,2,1,12
Ross? Can we just close the door?,Rachel Green,10,2,1,13
"Ross, say something. Anything.",Rachel Green,10,2,2,1

And have you .. ed?,Ross Geller,10,2,2,4
"No, no, no!",Joey Tribbiani,10,2,2,5

"But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?",Ross Geller,10,2,2,7
Probably.,Joey Tribbiani,10,2,2,8
"No, no!",Joey Tribbiani,10,2,2,9
"Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.",Rachel Green,10,2,2,10
I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?,Ross Geller,10,2,2,11
"No, but you know what I mean.",Rachel Green,10,2,2,12
"Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you. I'm fine!",Ross Geller,10,2,2,13
Really?,Joey Tribbiani,10,2,2,14
"Absolutely. I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like.. But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.",Ross Geller,10,2,2,15
Ross..,Joey Tribbiani,10,2,2,16
"It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?",Ross Geller,10,2,2,17
Calm ourselves?,Rachel Green,10,2,2,18
"No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!",Ross Geller,10,2,2,19
"Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?",Joey Tribbiani,10,2,2,20
"Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!!",Ross Geller,10,2,2,21
I do like fajitas.,Joey Tribbiani,10,2,2,22
"God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.",Monica Geller,10,2,3,1
There's a hair in my coffee.,Chandler Bing,10,2,3,2

Hey.,Monica Geller,10,2,3,4
"Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.",Phoebe Buffay,10,2,3,5
"You know, it's funny. Every time you say ""triplets,"" I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.",Chandler Bing,10,2,3,6
That's sweet. Drink your hair.,Monica Geller,10,2,3,7
"Hey, what's all this stuff?",Phoebe Buffay,10,2,3,8

That's not really how it works.,Monica Geller,10,2,3,11
"Oh, how does it work?",Phoebe Buffay,10,2,3,12
I don't know!,Monica Geller,10,2,3,13
"Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.",Phoebe Buffay,10,2,3,14
"Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?",Monica Geller,10,2,3,15
Hey!,Phoebe Buffay,10,2,3,18
Good to see you.,Phoebe Buffay,10,2,3,20
Hi Frank.,Monica Geller,10,2,3,22

"""Willing to adopt triplets?"" No!",Monica Geller,10,2,3,27
"Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.",Joey Tribbiani,10,2,4,1
"Well, what would we be doing?",Rachel Green,10,2,4,2
"I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...",Joey Tribbiani,10,2,4,3
Feel me up?,Rachel Green,10,2,4,4
In a carriage!,Joey Tribbiani,10,2,4,5

"Oh. Oh, thanks.",Joey Tribbiani,10,2,4,12
"Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..",Joey Tribbiani,10,2,4,14
"I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! Hi Joey. And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. Come, please come in. Come in.",Ross Geller,10,2,4,15
"Okay, well, we brought you some wine.",Rachel Green,10,2,4,16

"Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!",Ross Geller,10,2,4,19
What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?,Ross Geller,10,2,4,21
"Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.",Joey Tribbiani,10,2,4,22
You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.,Ross Geller,10,2,4,23
"Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.",Phoebe Buffay,10,2,5,1
"Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.",Phoebe Buffay,10,2,5,3
"Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..",Phoebe Buffay,10,2,5,5
"That's a, that's a long time.",Phoebe Buffay,10,2,5,7
"Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.",Phoebe Buffay,10,2,5,9
What?,Phoebe Buffay,10,2,5,11
"Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!",Phoebe Buffay,10,2,5,13
What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?,Phoebe Buffay,10,2,5,15

"Hey, you must be Owen.",Chandler Bing,10,2,6,19
"I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.",Chandler Bing,10,2,6,21
"Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.",Chandler Bing,10,2,6,23
You know how to use a compass?,Chandler Bing,10,2,6,25
You do? That's fantastic!,Chandler Bing,10,2,6,27
"I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.",Chandler Bing,10,2,6,29
What?,Chandler Bing,10,2,6,31
I got nothing.,Chandler Bing,10,2,6,33
"The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.",Ross Geller,10,2,7,1
"Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.",Rachel Green,10,2,7,2
"Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.",Ross Geller,10,2,7,3
"Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?",Joey Tribbiani,10,2,7,4
"I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.",Ross Geller,10,2,7,5
No awareness.,Rachel Green,10,2,7,6
"We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?",Ross Geller,10,2,7,7
My fajitas!!,Ross Geller,10,2,7,8
"Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.",Rachel Green,10,2,7,9
"Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!",Ross Geller,10,2,7,12
"Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!",Rachel Green,10,2,7,13
That is gonna hurt tomorrow!,Ross Geller,10,2,7,14
"Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?",Phoebe Buffay,10,2,8,1
Insane.,Phoebe Buffay,10,2,8,3
"Alice would never go for it, right?",Phoebe Buffay,10,2,8,5
"Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?",Phoebe Buffay,10,2,8,7
Frank Jr.Jr.?,Phoebe Buffay,10,2,8,9
Uh-huh.,Phoebe Buffay,10,2,8,11
"Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?",Phoebe Buffay,10,2,8,13
"Alright, so that leaves Chandler.",Phoebe Buffay,10,2,8,15
"Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.",Phoebe Buffay,10,2,8,17
"I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.",Phoebe Buffay,10,2,8,19
"Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.",Phoebe Buffay,10,2,8,21
"Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for. Frank Jr. : Look at them! Aw. I love you so much. Oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up!",Phoebe Buffay,10,2,8,23
Where are Bill and Colleen?,Chandler Bing,10,2,9,1

We have to leave!!,Chandler Bing,10,2,9,3
Why? What did you do in the bathroom?,Monica Geller,10,2,9,4
"I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.",Chandler Bing,10,2,9,5
"Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!",Monica Geller,10,2,9,6
But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?,Chandler Bing,10,2,9,10
See? Intuitive!,Chandler Bing,10,2,9,12
Which technically now you should give back!,Chandler Bing,10,2,9,15
"I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. ""Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real.""",Chandler Bing,10,2,9,17
"We have to get out of here, baby!",Chandler Bing,10,2,9,19
Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.,Ross Geller,10,2,10,1

"Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?",Rachel Green,10,2,10,4
"O is for ""oh, wow!"" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.",Ross Geller,10,2,10,5
"Dude, are you okay?",Joey Tribbiani,10,2,10,6
Totally.,Ross Geller,10,2,10,7
"Ross, you don't seem okay.",Rachel Green,10,2,10,8
"I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.",Ross Geller,10,2,10,9
No!,Ross Geller,10,2,10,11
Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.,Ross Geller,10,2,10,13
Okay.,Ross Geller,10,2,10,15
"Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.",Rachel Green,10,2,10,18

"You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.",Rachel Green,10,2,10,21
"Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.",Ross Geller,10,2,10,22

"All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.",Monica Geller,10,4,1,18
"Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...",Chandler Bing,10,4,1,19
"Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!",Monica Geller,10,4,1,20
"You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.",Rachel Green,10,4,2,1
"Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!",Phoebe Buffay,10,4,2,2
Hey guys!,Ross Geller,10,4,2,3
"Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.",Ross Geller,10,4,2,5
"Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.",Rachel Green,10,4,2,6
"Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!",Phoebe Buffay,10,4,2,7
Yeah!,Ross Geller,10,4,2,8
"Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!",Phoebe Buffay,10,4,2,9
"That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?",Ross Geller,10,4,2,10
"Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.",Rachel Green,10,4,2,11
"Ah, and where is Joey?",Ross Geller,10,4,2,12
I said it's still nap time.,Rachel Green,10,4,2,13
"Hey, there is uncle Joey!",Ross Geller,10,4,2,14
Hey!,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,2,15
"Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!",Ross Geller,10,4,2,16
"18, uh?",Joey Tribbiani,10,4,2,17
"Joey, NO!",Ross Geller,10,4,2,18
"What, what!? it's for her hot friends!",Joey Tribbiani,10,4,2,19
When they see this you'll be 52!,Ross Geller,10,4,2,20
And starting to think about settling down!,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,2,21
"Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?",Rachel Green,10,4,2,22
I'd love to! Yeah!,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,2,23
We were supposed to bring presents?,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,2,24
Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.,Phoebe Buffay,10,4,2,25
"Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?",Joey Tribbiani,10,4,2,26
"Joey, it's a birthday party.",Phoebe Buffay,10,4,2,27
"Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says ""El-moo""! Yeah... that's a funny cup!",Joey Tribbiani,10,4,2,28
Hey!,Monica Geller,10,4,2,29
Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?,Chandler Bing,10,4,2,30
"Oh, she's still napping.",Rachel Green,10,4,2,31
"Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.",Chandler Bing,10,4,2,32
"Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.",Rachel Green,10,4,2,33
All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!,Monica Geller,10,4,2,34
"No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.",Rachel Green,10,4,2,35
"Are you freaking kidding me, Green?",Monica Geller,10,4,2,36
Hey!,Ross Geller,10,4,2,38
So glad you came!,Monica Geller,10,4,2,39
There's something you didn't know about your dad!,Ross Geller,10,4,2,42
Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,2,43
"Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!",Joey Tribbiani,10,4,2,45
I can't believe Emma is still asleep!,Monica Geller,10,4,2,47
"I know, what are we gonna do?",Chandler Bing,10,4,2,48
I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!,Monica Geller,10,4,2,49
I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!,Chandler Bing,10,4,2,50
"Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!",Joey Tribbiani,10,4,2,51
So you're gonna... hit on her?,Phoebe Buffay,10,4,2,52
"No, no, no! My talents as an actor!",Joey Tribbiani,10,4,2,53
Oh!,Phoebe Buffay,10,4,2,54
"You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!",Joey Tribbiani,10,4,2,55
Or you could stick a fork in an apple!,Phoebe Buffay,10,4,2,56
"Hey, I think Emma might like it!",Joey Tribbiani,10,4,2,57
Oh! Emma might like what?,Rachel Green,10,4,2,58
"Um, my present!",Joey Tribbiani,10,4,2,59
What did you get her?,Rachel Green,10,4,2,60
Actually we prepared performances.,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,2,61
Separate performances.,Phoebe Buffay,10,4,2,62
But equally real!,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,2,63
"Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?",Rachel Green,10,4,2,64
"Sure, yeah!",Phoebe Buffay,10,4,2,65
O K.,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,2,66
"All right, let's get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.",Rachel Green,10,4,2,67
"Oh, great!",Ross Geller,10,4,2,68
Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?,Phoebe Buffay,10,4,2,69
"Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!",Joey Tribbiani,10,4,2,70
"So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?",Rachel Green,10,4,2,71
I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma's books.,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,2,72
"Oh, ok, which one?",Rachel Green,10,4,2,73
"Uh, why, it's a... one of her favorites, uh, ""Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depression"" eesh! ""Love you forever"". Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang ""I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be"". . And while he rocked her, he sang ""I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be"".",Joey Tribbiani,10,4,2,74
Wow! That was amazing!,Rachel Green,10,4,2,75
Thank you so much for that gift!,Ross Geller,10,4,2,76
I was not ready for this today!,Chandler Bing,10,4,2,77
Amazing... amazing.,Ross Geller,10,4,2,78
"Oh, Phoebe, I'm sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.",Rachel Green,10,4,2,79
"That's right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there's no greater gift, than the gift of music. Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!",Phoebe Buffay,10,4,2,80
Is that it?,Rachel Green,10,4,2,81
"No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading . ""Sex and the single mother. Finding your G-spot.",Phoebe Buffay,10,4,2,82
"Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!",Ross Geller,10,4,3,8
"Ross, um, don't forget to get a shot of Emma's cake. It's in a box in the fridge.",Rachel Green,10,4,3,9
Sure.,Ross Geller,10,4,3,10
"Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino's.",Rachel Green,10,4,3,11
"Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.",Monica Geller,10,4,3,12
"Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they'll copy it in icing!",Rachel Green,10,4,3,13
"Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?",Monica Geller,10,4,3,14
Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.,Rachel Green,10,4,3,15
"Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?",Ross Geller,10,4,3,16
"Ross, what are you talking about? oh! Oh my God! They put my baby's face on a penis!",Rachel Green,10,4,3,17
oh! Now it's a party!,Phoebe Buffay,10,4,3,18
"Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!",Rachel Green,10,4,3,19
Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,20
I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.,Ross Geller,10,4,3,23
"No, no, this is not what I ordered. Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughter's birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!",Rachel Green,10,4,3,24
"Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby's face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!",Ross Geller,10,4,3,25
"Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home... Joey, don't touch it!!",Rachel Green,10,4,3,26
I'm so confused!,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,27
"Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!",Rachel Green,10,4,3,28
To be fair this one does have nuts.,Chandler Bing,10,4,3,29
"Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.",Ross Geller,10,4,3,30
"Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!",Monica Geller,10,4,3,31
"Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? Ok!",Ross Geller,10,4,3,32
Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?,Chandler Bing,10,4,3,33
"We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!",Monica Geller,10,4,3,34
"We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday.",Chandler Bing,10,4,3,35
"Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.",Monica Geller,10,4,3,36
"And you know, I have a massage client soon.",Phoebe Buffay,10,4,3,37
"You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?",Ross Geller,10,4,3,38
"Alright, 5 more minutes.",Monica Geller,10,4,3,39
"Hello? Oh no! What happened? Ok ok, where are you? . Ok, I'll be right there.",Ross Geller,10,4,3,40
Was that Emma? Is she up?,Chandler Bing,10,4,3,41
"No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.",Ross Geller,10,4,3,42
"Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.",Phoebe Buffay,10,4,3,43
No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us We've been complaining the longest!,Monica Geller,10,4,3,44
"No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?",Ross Geller,10,4,3,45
I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!,Chandler Bing,10,4,3,46
"Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves!",Ross Geller,10,4,3,47
Got it! Hey hey hey! Where do you think you're going?,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,48
To the bathroom!,Chandler Bing,10,4,3,49
"Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna be here for a li... Wait a minute, there is a window in there!",Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,50
Oh no! He's not getting away that easy!,Phoebe Buffay,10,4,3,51
What are you doing? Get the hell out of here!,Chandler Bing,10,4,3,52
"Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.",Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,53
"No, it did not.",Phoebe Buffay,10,4,3,54
No.,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,55
Ok!,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,59
Nighty-night!,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,61

"Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country.",Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,65
"No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.",Monica Geller,10,4,3,66
Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in.,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,67
"You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?",Chandler Bing,10,4,3,68
Oh! I forgot you used to live here!,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,69
Hello?,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,70
Hey!,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,72
What audition?,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,74
What? You never said anything about an audition!,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,76
A monologue? I don't have.. I got it. Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,78
"Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!",Phoebe Buffay,10,4,3,79
"Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!",Monica Geller,10,4,3,80
"Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!",Phoebe Buffay,10,4,3,81
No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.,Monica Geller,10,4,3,82
"Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.",Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,83
"Ok, ten.",Monica Geller,10,4,3,84
"Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?",Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,85
"No, lets just draw straws.",Phoebe Buffay,10,4,3,86
"Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..",Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,87
I'm begging you stop.,Chandler Bing,10,4,3,88
Right.,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,89
"Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!",Monica Geller,10,4,3,90
Yeah!! Let's do that!,Phoebe Buffay,10,4,3,91
That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!,Chandler Bing,10,4,3,92
Everybody get your toys!,Monica Geller,10,4,3,93
Ok! I want the dolphin!,Phoebe Buffay,10,4,3,94

"Yeah, see you later!",Phoebe Buffay,10,4,3,108

They left.,Chandler Bing,10,4,3,110
"No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can. Bye...",Rachel Green,10,4,3,111
RACHEL!,Ross Geller,10,4,3,112

I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.,Ross Geller,10,4,3,114
Emma's awake.,Rachel Green,10,4,3,115
Yeah?,Ross Geller,10,4,3,116
I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.,Rachel Green,10,4,3,117
"Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.",Ross Geller,10,4,3,118
"Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.",Rachel Green,10,4,3,119
"Rach, she's not going to remember this.",Ross Geller,10,4,3,120
"I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing ""Happy Birthday"". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! They have to learn!",Rachel Green,10,4,3,121
Hey!,Ross Geller,10,4,3,122
What?,Rachel Green,10,4,3,123
It's not bad.,Ross Geller,10,4,3,124
Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?,Rachel Green,10,4,3,125
"Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.",Ross Geller,10,4,3,126
"Well, I'm very impressed.",Rachel Green,10,4,3,127
"Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.",Ross Geller,10,4,3,128
"Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.",Monica Geller,10,4,3,129
"I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?",Chandler Bing,10,4,3,130
Game?,Monica Geller,10,4,3,131
"Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.",Chandler Bing,10,4,3,132
Ooh! That's my girl!,Chandler Bing,10,4,3,133
That's how old you are.,Monica Geller,10,4,3,134
Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?,Chandler Bing,10,4,3,135
"Ooh, I want one...",Monica Geller,10,4,3,136
Me too...,Chandler Bing,10,4,3,137
There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?,Chandler Bing,10,4,3,138
...and head to Canada!,Monica Geller,10,4,3,139
I was kidding.,Chandler Bing,10,4,3,140
I wasn't. Let's get going!,Monica Geller,10,4,3,141
"Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?",Phoebe Buffay,10,4,3,142

"Oh good, I didn't miss the party.",Phoebe Buffay,10,4,3,144
What about your massage client?,Monica Geller,10,4,3,145
"I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.",Phoebe Buffay,10,4,3,146
"Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!",Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,147
I've been here the whole time!,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,148

"Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.",Rachel Green,10,4,3,164
"Hey, you made it into a bunny.",Phoebe Buffay,10,4,3,165
What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis.,Joey Tribbiani,10,4,3,166
Okay.,Rachel Green,10,4,4,1
"Okay, you ready?",Ross Geller,10,4,4,2
Yeah.,Rachel Green,10,4,4,3

"Go, go, go Alan! Run you, hairy bastard! end.",Phoebe Buffay,10,4,4,6
"You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.",Rachel Green,10,5,1,1
Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!,Joey Tribbiani,10,5,1,2
I've never given her a cookie. Have you?,Rachel Green,10,5,1,3
"No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!",Joey Tribbiani,10,5,1,4
"Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.",Monica Geller,10,5,1,5
"Of course, I'd be honored!",Rachel Green,10,5,1,6
Thanks!,Chandler Bing,10,5,1,7
Thank you!,Monica Geller,10,5,1,8
"U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.",Joey Tribbiani,10,5,1,9
"Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.",Chandler Bing,10,5,1,10
"Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much ""with the words"".",Monica Geller,10,5,1,11
Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!,Joey Tribbiani,10,5,1,12
Clearly we were wrong.,Monica Geller,10,5,1,13
"I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.",Joey Tribbiani,10,5,1,14

"Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.",Phoebe Buffay,10,5,1,26
Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?,Joey Tribbiani,10,5,1,27

"Hey Joey, I don't think we can use this.",Monica Geller,10,5,6,12

'Cause we will appreciate it more when she's gone?,Joey Tribbiani,10,5,8,7

"Yeah, Monica made us!",Joey Tribbiani,10,5,8,9
"Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don't think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn't for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it's gonna take patience, but that's ok.",Rachel Green,10,5,8,10

"Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.",Ross Geller,10,5,9,49
Wha... the next one?,Rachel Green,10,5,9,50
"Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.",Ross Geller,10,5,9,51
"Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!",Rachel Green,10,5,9,52
I... I don't know..,Ross Geller,10,5,9,53
"Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?",Rachel Green,10,5,9,54

You hand-wrote it?,Monica Geller,10,5,10,7
"Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later!",Joey Tribbiani,10,5,10,8
"Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!",Monica Geller,10,5,10,9
"It's ok, it's ok. You know what? I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter.",Chandler Bing,10,5,10,10
Okay good.,Monica Geller,10,5,10,11
"Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. .",Chandler Bing,10,5,10,12

"Nah, I don't really want her to see.",Rachel Green,10,5,10,39
Why not?,Ross Geller,10,5,10,40
Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.,Monica Geller,10,5,10,41
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?,Chandler Bing,10,5,10,42

Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!,Chandler Bing,10,5,10,53

Did you just say Emma?,Rachel Green,10,5,12,24
"That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.",Phoebe Buffay,10,5,13,1
"I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.",Phoebe Buffay,10,5,13,3
"It's in the cake, isn't it?",Phoebe Buffay,10,5,13,4

"Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.",Rachel Green,10,6,5,17
"That's good! I liked it, they didn't. Joey, for God's sake, go to work! .",Chandler Bing,10,6,5,18
I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?,Ross Geller,10,6,6,1

"Wow, what's the bad news!",Monica Geller,10,6,7,4

What did I just say?,Chandler Bing,10,6,10,3

You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?,Joey Tribbiani,10,6,10,8
"Well, this is going well.",Rachel Green,10,6,10,9
"Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan.",Joey Tribbiani,10,6,10,10

Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!,Rachel Green,10,6,11,9
Are you still here?,Monica Geller,10,6,11,10

"Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.",Rachel Green,10,6,13,10

GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!,Joey Tribbiani,10,6,13,12

"Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.",Ross Geller,10,6,16,5
"Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of ""Underdog""?",Ross Geller,10,6,16,7
"If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.",Ross Geller,10,6,16,9
"Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?",Ross Geller,10,6,16,11

"Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.",Chandler Bing,10,7,1,9
So what did you two do about it?,Phoebe Buffay,10,7,1,10
"It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.",Chandler Bing,10,7,1,11
"There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.",Ross Geller,10,7,1,12
"Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.",Ross Geller,10,7,1,14
"But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?",Phoebe Buffay,10,7,1,15
"Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?",Phoebe Buffay,10,7,1,17
"I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!",Ross Geller,10,7,1,19
Maybe you do that next time you get married!,Chandler Bing,10,7,1,20
"No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. But maybe the time after that!",Ross Geller,10,7,1,21
Hey!,Joey Tribbiani,10,7,2,2

Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.,Chandler Bing,10,7,2,9
"And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.",Monica Geller,10,7,2,10
"Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.",Joey Tribbiani,10,7,2,11
Little people?,Chandler Bing,10,7,2,12
Celebrity.,Joey Tribbiani,10,7,2,13

"I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.",Chandler Bing,10,7,2,19
It isn't mine!,Monica Geller,10,7,2,20

"Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!",Ross Geller,10,7,4,9
"Oh my God, what!?",Rachel Green,10,7,4,10
Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!,Ross Geller,10,7,4,11
"Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.",Rachel Green,10,7,4,12
Be-caaauuuse...,Ross Geller,10,7,4,13
"All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.",Rachel Green,10,7,4,14
Seriously?,Ross Geller,10,7,4,15

And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!,Ross Geller,10,7,4,17

All right!,Rachel Green,10,7,4,22
"Good, you don't want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?",Ross Geller,10,7,4,23
"Irrational, huh? All right, well, I'll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!",Rachel Green,10,7,4,24
"Oh, yeah, that's the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!",Ross Geller,10,7,4,25
"Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!",Monica Geller,10,7,5,1

I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!,Monica Geller,10,7,5,8
"No, no, no, we're not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.",Phoebe Buffay,10,7,5,9
That's crazy! . I am sorry. I just can't imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!,Monica Geller,10,7,5,10
"We, you know, we're different! We don't care about having a huge party. This is really nice for you, but, oh, please, I put this on? And, ow, I look , why, well, radiant. All right, well, who cares, I don't need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.",Phoebe Buffay,10,7,5,11
"That's right. You're making a commitment and that's the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?",Monica Geller,10,7,5,12
City Hall.,Phoebe Buffay,10,7,5,13

"Hey, that's not fair! A person's wedding is important! And especially to me! Ok? I didn't have a graduation party! And I didn't go to Prom.

"Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets hurt?",Rachel Green,10,7,9,5

"And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't shot anyone in a really long time.",Phoebe Buffay,10,7,11,8
We're back!,Phoebe Buffay,10,7,12,1
"Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children.",Phoebe Buffay,10,7,12,4

Hey!,Phoebe Buffay,10,8,1,7
Are you kidding?,Ross Geller,10,8,1,8
"Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.",Chandler Bing,10,8,1,9
That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!,Ross Geller,10,8,1,10
"No, no! We made this decision together.",Chandler Bing,10,8,1,11

"What? You are way off, lady!",Monica Geller,10,8,1,20
"Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.",Phoebe Buffay,10,8,1,21
"That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!",Monica Geller,10,8,1,22
Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!,Chandler Bing,10,8,1,23
"Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!",Monica Geller,10,8,1,24

You're not making the pies yourself?,Phoebe Buffay,10,8,2,5

"Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!",Rachel Green,10,8,2,18
Oh... okay.,Phoebe Buffay,10,8,2,19

And a thousand dollars.,Rachel Green,10,8,2,21
"...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that what's in the inside is important...",Rachel Green,10,8,2,22

"Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.",Monica Geller,10,8,3,13
"I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing ""high profile"".",Chandler Bing,10,8,3,14
"Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.",Monica Geller,10,8,3,15

"So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.",Joey Tribbiani,10,8,3,31
"You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.",Chandler Bing,10,8,3,32
"Dude, two times that happened!",Joey Tribbiani,10,8,3,33
"Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!",Chandler Bing,10,8,3,34

That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.,Ross Geller,10,8,8,11

"Alright, come on... Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.",Rachel Green,10,8,8,29

Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.,Ross Geller,10,11,13,5
Oh my God! That's wild!,Monica Geller,10,11,13,6
"Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.",Chandler Bing,10,11,13,7
"Well, it matters to me.",Ross Geller,10,11,13,8
Why?,Chandler Bing,10,11,13,9
Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.,Ross Geller,10,11,13,10
You kissed her that night too?,Chandler Bing,10,11,13,11
"Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.",Monica Geller,10,11,13,12
"Seriously, where did this happen?",Chandler Bing,10,11,13,13
"Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.",Ross Geller,10,11,13,14
Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?,Chandler Bing,10,11,13,15
Mine.,Ross Geller,10,11,13,16
I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.,Chandler Bing,10,11,13,17
"No, she was definitely on my bed.",Ross Geller,10,11,13,18
"Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?",Chandler Bing,10,11,13,19
"Well, then who was on my bed?",Ross Geller,10,11,13,20
"OH! Oh, oh!",Monica Geller,10,11,13,21
"NO! No, no!",Ross Geller,10,11,13,22
YES!,Monica Geller,10,11,13,23
You were under the pile of coats?,Ross Geller,10,11,13,24
I was the pile of coats!,Monica Geller,10,11,13,25
OH MY GOD!,Ross Geller,10,11,13,26
You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?,Monica Geller,10,11,13,27
You were my first kiss with Rachel?,Ross Geller,10,11,13,28
You were my first kiss ever?,Monica Geller,10,11,13,29
What did I marry into?,Chandler Bing,10,11,13,30
"Oh, crap!",Monica Geller,10,11,14,2
"Oh, hey Joey.",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,1,1
"Uh, hey.",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,1,2
"Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison.",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,1,3
Yeah.,Joey Tribbiani,10,12,1,4
"Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,1,5
So he can't come?,Joey Tribbiani,10,12,1,6
"No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,1,7
Seriously?,Joey Tribbiani,10,12,1,8
"Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,1,9
I am pretty wisdomous.,Joey Tribbiani,10,12,1,10
So... what do you say?,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,1,11
"Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,1,12
"Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,1,13
"Listen, I hope... that you know... I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,1,14
Oh.,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,2,1
"Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,2,2
"Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,2,3
"Well, it matters to me!",Monica Geller,10,12,2,4
"Well, I don't care, so you pick!",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,2,5
"Did you just hung up on me? All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.",Monica Geller,10,12,2,6
Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,2,7
You don't know military time?,Monica Geller,10,12,2,8
"Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,2,9
Just subtract twelve.,Monica Geller,10,12,2,10
"Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,2,11
Six o'clock!,Monica Geller,10,12,2,12
Ok.,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,2,13
"Ok. Hold on. Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?",Monica Geller,10,12,2,14
Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,2,15
"Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.",Monica Geller,10,12,2,16
What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,2,17
Ooh... she backed out.,Monica Geller,10,12,2,18
She did? Why?,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,2,19
"I made her. Steel drums don't really say ""elegant wedding"". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.",Monica Geller,10,12,2,20
Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,2,21
Hey!,Chandler Bing,10,12,3,1
Hey!,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,3,2
"You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.",Chandler Bing,10,12,3,3
"Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,3,4
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.,Chandler Bing,10,12,3,5
Rehearse it!,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,3,6

So Rach.,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,3,13
Yeah.,Rachel Green,10,12,3,14
Where is Emma?,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,3,15
"Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.",Rachel Green,10,12,3,16
"Are you still crying about your damn baby? Pheebs, you gotta keep the line moving, remember, 20 seconds per person. Your see these clowns all the time!",Monica Geller,10,12,3,17
"Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,3,18
"Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,3,20
"You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go.",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,3,22
"Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,3,24
You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.,Chandler Bing,10,12,3,25
"Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?",Ross Geller,10,12,3,26
Uh... November?,Rachel Green,10,12,3,27
I wanna say it's not looking good.,Ross Geller,10,12,3,28
Hey Pheebs...,Rachel Green,10,12,3,29
What's up?,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,3,30
Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.,Rachel Green,10,12,3,31
Heh.,Chandler Bing,10,12,3,32
"Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,3,33
What?,Ross Geller,10,12,3,34
"Well, this is really awkward Oh, and I can leave!",Rachel Green,10,12,3,35
"I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,3,36
"Oh, man!",Ross Geller,10,12,3,37
This is like figure skating team all over again. I mean synchronized swimming. I mean- I mean the balance beam. Help me!,Chandler Bing,10,12,3,38
FOOTBALL!,Ross Geller,10,12,3,39
Thank you.,Chandler Bing,10,12,3,40
"Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.",Monica Geller,10,12,3,41
Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,3,42
"Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!",Monica Geller,10,12,3,43
I don't have a fax machine.,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,3,44
"Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!",Monica Geller,10,12,3,45
I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.,Ross Geller,10,12,3,46
"I know, I hate being left out of things.",Chandler Bing,10,12,3,47
And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...,Ross Geller,10,12,3,48
Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.,Chandler Bing,10,12,3,50
What happened?,Chandler Bing,10,12,3,52
"Who cares, AND?",Ross Geller,10,12,3,53
I'll do it!,Ross Geller,10,12,3,55
M-Me-me-me!,Chandler Bing,10,12,3,56
"Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.",Chandler Bing,10,12,3,58
"No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch! Huh?",Ross Geller,10,12,3,59
"Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.",Ross Geller,10,12,3,61
"Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!",Chandler Bing,10,12,3,62
"Please, you're going down!",Ross Geller,10,12,3,63
You are going downer!,Chandler Bing,10,12,3,64
Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?,Ross Geller,10,12,3,65
"I wouldn't know, I didn't make it!",Chandler Bing,10,12,3,66
"So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,4,1
"Oh, hey, my pleasure. So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,4,3
"Oh, a wiseacre. . No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,4,5
Strike two!,Joey Tribbiani,10,12,4,7
"Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,4,9
"So, what did you decide?",Ross Geller,10,12,4,10
I decided to pee.,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,4,11
Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.,Chandler Bing,10,12,4,12
"Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,4,13
Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.,Chandler Bing,10,12,4,14
"Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's . Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,4,15
"Goody, what is it!",Rachel Green,10,12,4,16
"Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,4,17
"What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.",Rachel Green,10,12,4,18
"All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,4,19
I'll do it!,Ross Geller,10,12,4,20
"Ok, it's 2100 hours. Time for your toast.",Monica Geller,10,12,4,21
"You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! . Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!",Monica Geller,10,12,4,23
"It's 2101 and I am not amused. . Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say.",Monica Geller,10,12,4,25
"Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start. . My friend Joey and I decided to fix each other up with friends so I, I... oh I... hum... I gave it a lot of thought and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen who couldn't be here tonight because... it's not important... she is in rehab. Anyway, so, ok, Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike, only he didn't have a friend Mike so he just brought, uhm, my Mike and, and but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,4,26
oh God.,Monica Geller,10,12,4,27
"And... moment's over! So, ok, uh, I can forget that. I can forget that and uhm... Oh this is funny! Oh, but you need to know that to... that, to... Oh, ok, well, uhm, I . Ok, ok, I, ok, I.... MONICA I CAN'T DO IT LIKE THIS! THIS IS MY WEDDING! OKAY, I DON'T WANT THIS OR THIS OR THIS OK? I JUST WANTED A SIMPLE WEDDING! WHERE MY FIANCEE CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM ANYTIME HE WANTS! You know what? You're done.",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,4,28
What?,Monica Geller,10,12,4,29
YOU'RE FIRED! Cheers!,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,4,30
Hey!,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,5,1
Happy wedding day!,Rachel Green,10,12,5,2
"Oh, happy my wedding day to you!",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,5,3
"Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.",Rachel Green,10,12,5,4
"Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,5,5
"Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.",Monica Geller,10,12,5,6
"Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,5,7
"Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages.",Monica Geller,10,12,5,8
"Wow, this is a lot!",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,5,9
"Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.",Monica Geller,10,12,5,10
You won awards?,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,5,11
Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.,Monica Geller,10,12,5,12

Hi.,Monica Geller,10,12,5,14
Where's Rach?,Ross Geller,10,12,5,15
"She's in her room, why?",Monica Geller,10,12,5,16
"I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! . Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!",Ross Geller,10,12,5,17
What d'you want?,Rachel Green,10,12,5,18
"You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?",Ross Geller,10,12,5,19
"Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!",Rachel Green,10,12,5,20
I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!,Ross Geller,10,12,5,21
"Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!",Rachel Green,10,12,5,22
"Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!",Ross Geller,10,12,5,23
"Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!",Rachel Green,10,12,5,24
"YES, YES!",Ross Geller,10,12,5,25
Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,6,1
I know. .,Monica Geller,10,12,6,2
"Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word ""lorkins"" what flowers would that be?",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,6,4
Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,6,6
Hello Michael.,Joey Tribbiani,10,12,6,7
"May I have a word with you, please?",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,6,9
"Have a seat. Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... I cannot allow this.",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,6,11
"More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for ""Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal.""",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,6,13
"I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,6,15
"That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,6,17
That was ME!,Joey Tribbiani,10,12,6,19
Hi.,Rachel Green,10,12,7,1
"Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!",Chandler Bing,10,12,7,2
"Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.",Rachel Green,10,12,7,3
"Let me tell you why you need to pick me. See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.",Chandler Bing,10,12,7,4
"All right fine, I pick you.",Rachel Green,10,12,7,5
"Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make ""groom"" for Chandler.",Chandler Bing,10,12,7,6
Oh my...,Rachel Green,10,12,7,7

I'm glad we had this little talk.,Joey Tribbiani,10,12,8,2
Okay.,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,8,4
Bye.,Monica Geller,10,12,8,5
"Oh my God, what's it doing here?",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,8,7
"Ugh, I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address. Uh! What a pickle.",Monica Geller,10,12,8,8
"Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,8,9
How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?,Joey Tribbiani,10,12,8,10
How's it going?,Chandler Bing,10,12,9,1
Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.,Ross Geller,10,12,9,2

"Well, you have fun tonight.",Ross Geller,10,12,9,4
You too.,Chandler Bing,10,12,9,5
"Oh, I will.",Ross Geller,10,12,9,6

"Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?",Ross Geller,10,12,9,8
I'm not supposed to tell you.,Chandler Bing,10,12,9,9
I'm not supposed to tell you!,Ross Geller,10,12,9,10
You told us both we could be in the wedding?,Chandler Bing,10,12,9,11
"Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.",Rachel Green,10,12,9,12
"Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again.",Ross Geller,10,12,9,13
"Rach, Rach, knock knock.",Chandler Bing,10,12,9,14
Who's there?,Rachel Green,10,12,9,15
I'll tell you at the wedding.,Chandler Bing,10,12,9,16
Uh.,Rachel Green,10,12,9,17
"You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.",Rachel Green,10,12,9,19
What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.,Ross Geller,10,12,9,21
"Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.",Rachel Green,10,12,9,22
"Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,9,23
How's it going?,Monica Geller,10,12,9,24
Help me.,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,9,25

"Hey, what are you guys gonna do?",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,9,33
About what?,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,9,34
"The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels.",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,9,35
Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!,Monica Geller,10,12,9,36
I don't think they are.,Joey Tribbiani,10,12,9,37
Haha! Looks like you're not going to be in the wedding either. So sorry Pheebs.,Ross Geller,10,12,9,38
"Well, the club lost it's power.",Monica Geller,10,12,10,1
"Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,10,2
Since when do you watch the news?,Rachel Green,10,12,10,3
"Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,10,4
I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.,Ross Geller,10,12,10,5
I know.,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,10,6
"Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?",Rachel Green,10,12,10,7
What?,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,10,8
"Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!",Rachel Green,10,12,10,9
What do you think?,Phoebe Buffay,10,12,10,10
"Me too! Monica, do you think we could do it?",Phoebe Buffay,10,12,10,12
AFFIRMATIVE!,Monica Geller,10,12,10,13
"OK LET'S GET THESE CHAIRS OUT HERE! Gunther, hit the Christmas lights. Okay, who left the ice sculpture ON THE STEAM GRATE?",Monica Geller,10,12,11,1
"So technically, would this person be in the wedding?",Chandler Bing,10,12,11,7
"No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?",Ross Geller,10,12,11,10
I'm not scared. I'll just take little Chappy and... HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.,Chandler Bing,10,12,11,11
"Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then. Ha haaa... He stinks!",Ross Geller,10,12,11,12
"Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.",Monica Geller,10,12,11,13
"Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.",Joey Tribbiani,10,12,11,15
Really?,Monica Geller,10,12,11,16

I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye!,Joey Tribbiani,10,14,2,33

"Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.",Monica Geller,10,14,5,4
"Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.",Phoebe Buffay,10,14,5,5
That's what we were gonna name the baby.,Chandler Bing,10,14,5,6
Phoebe!,Monica Geller,10,14,5,7

"Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.",Rachel Green,10,14,5,16
That is a bad interview.,Chandler Bing,10,14,5,17
"What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?",Phoebe Buffay,10,14,5,18
"Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said ""Wait a minute! Yes I am."" and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.",Rachel Green,10,14,5,19
Oh God. I'm so sorry.,Monica Geller,10,14,5,20
"Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this? Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?",Ross Geller,10,14,5,21

And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.,Ross Geller,10,14,5,34

But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.,Monica Geller,10,14,5,37

"No, it's okay, you didn't know.",Rachel Green,10,14,5,48
Oh... Little heads-up would have been nice.,Ross Geller,10,14,5,49
Thank you for letting us see the house again.,Monica Geller,10,14,6,1
"And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.",Chandler Bing,10,14,6,2
"Ah, so glad you decided to come.",Monica Geller,10,14,6,4
"Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.",Joey Tribbiani,10,14,6,5
What?,Chandler Bing,10,14,6,6
Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.,Joey Tribbiani,10,14,6,7
No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.,Monica Geller,10,14,6,8
Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.,Joey Tribbiani,10,14,6,9
Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.,Monica Geller,10,14,6,10
"Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark.",Joey Tribbiani,10,14,6,11

"When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?",Chandler Bing,10,14,6,14
"Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.",Joey Tribbiani,10,14,6,15
"Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.",Monica Geller,10,14,6,16
"FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...",Joey Tribbiani,10,14,6,17
"Joey, we know that's you.",Monica Geller,10,14,6,18

"Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!",Joey Tribbiani,10,14,8,9
"Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea.",Joey Tribbiani,10,14,8,11
"Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?",Joey Tribbiani,10,14,8,13
"What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.",Joey Tribbiani,10,14,8,15

Ugh.,Rachel Green,10,14,9,33
"I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?",Ross Geller,10,14,9,34
"Ross, you know what? Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security.",Rachel Green,10,14,9,35

"Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?",Ross Geller,10,15,1,35
How is that gonna happen?,Monica Geller,10,15,1,36
Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?,Chandler Bing,10,15,1,37
I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.,Ross Geller,10,15,1,38

I didn't say we were brothers.,Ross Geller,10,15,1,40
"Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.",Monica Geller,10,15,2,1
"We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.",Chandler Bing,10,15,2,2
But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?,Monica Geller,10,15,2,3
What do you think Pheebs?,Chandler Bing,10,15,2,4
"Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?",Phoebe Buffay,10,15,2,5

You're kidding!,Chandler Bing,10,15,2,8
That's terrible!,Monica Geller,10,15,2,9
"Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic. Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.",Phoebe Buffay,10,15,2,10
Oh yeah?,Chandler Bing,10,15,2,11
"Yeah, she was just an agent.",Phoebe Buffay,10,15,2,12
Joey's gonna be *so* upset.,Monica Geller,10,15,2,13
I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.,Chandler Bing,10,15,2,14
"Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.",Phoebe Buffay,10,15,2,15
"Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?",Monica Geller,10,15,2,16
"Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.",Phoebe Buffay,10,15,2,17
What if he reads it in the paper?,Monica Geller,10,15,2,18
"Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.",Chandler Bing,10,15,2,19
"Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.",Ross Geller,10,15,3,2

"Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.",Ross Geller,10,15,3,8
"Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true?",Ross Geller,10,15,3,10
"Huh, I took a shot there.",Ross Geller,10,15,3,12
I see... Thanks very much. Is this your son?,Ross Geller,10,15,3,14
"Oh, nothing, it's just, it's close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?",Ross Geller,10,15,3,16
"How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. . I just heard it as you must have heard it and that's not good. Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist, you'll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones... fossils!",Ross Geller,10,15,3,18
"You let Rachel come back, and it's done.",Ross Geller,10,15,3,20
"Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.",Ross Geller,10,15,3,22

Hey Phoebe.,Joey Tribbiani,10,15,4,1
Hey. Everything ok?,Phoebe Buffay,10,15,4,2
I'm just mad at my agent.,Joey Tribbiani,10,15,4,3
Estelle? Why?,Phoebe Buffay,10,15,4,4
There's a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn't even be put up for it! She'd better have a good reason.,Joey Tribbiani,10,15,4,5
I'm guessing she does.,Phoebe Buffay,10,15,4,6
"Well I'm wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.",Joey Tribbiani,10,15,4,7
"Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.",Phoebe Buffay,10,15,4,8
Ok. Why?,Joey Tribbiani,10,15,4,9
Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.,Phoebe Buffay,10,15,4,10
I love that saying! .,Joey Tribbiani,10,15,4,11
Hello?,Joey Tribbiani,10,15,4,12
"Joey, it's Estelle.",Phoebe Buffay,10,15,4,13
I was just gonna call you! That's weird.,Joey Tribbiani,10,15,4,14
"It's a little coincidental, but believable. . Listen, I'm sure you're wondering why I didn't get you an audition for that TV movie.",Phoebe Buffay,10,15,4,15
"Yeah, actually I am!",Joey Tribbiani,10,15,4,16
I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!,Phoebe Buffay,10,15,4,17
"That's it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.",Joey Tribbiani,10,15,4,18
"Don't take that tone with me. Who you think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?",Phoebe Buffay,10,15,4,19
"No, no, look. All I'm saying is that you're my agent, ok? And you're not getting me into any auditions and I'm tired of it.",Joey Tribbiani,10,15,4,20
What are you saying?,Phoebe Buffay,10,15,4,21
"I'm saying that... . This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you're fired. Goodbye. .",Joey Tribbiani,10,15,4,22
"Man, tough week for Estelle!",Phoebe Buffay,10,15,4,23

"Oh, well, she's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.",Rachel Green,10,15,5,4

"Oh, you're not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!",Rachel Green,10,15,5,6
Nooo!,Ross Geller,10,15,5,7
"Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.",Rachel Green,10,15,5,8
"So, you're not going to Paris.",Ross Geller,10,15,5,9
"No, I'm still going.",Rachel Green,10,15,5,10
Wh... wh...what?,Ross Geller,10,15,5,11
"When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn't that great?",Rachel Green,10,15,5,12
Yeeeah!,Ross Geller,10,15,5,13
"Hi. We're buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we could just take a look around.",Monica Geller,10,15,6,1
Thanks.,Monica Geller,10,15,6,3
"It feels like we're cheating on our house. And if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won't do?",Chandler Bing,10,15,6,4
"Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!",Monica Geller,10,15,6,5
Love it!,Monica Geller,10,15,6,7
"They could be our neighbors, what are they like?",Monica Geller,10,15,6,9
Sure.,Chandler Bing,10,15,6,12
"Hey Joey, want come with me to... are you ok?",Phoebe Buffay,10,15,7,1
"Yeah, I just... I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.",Joey Tribbiani,10,15,7,2
"No, that wouldn't kill her. Ordinary embolism might.",Phoebe Buffay,10,15,7,3
"I don't know. She's got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she's not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I'm gonna call her and hire her again.",Joey Tribbiani,10,15,7,4
"No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you.",Phoebe Buffay,10,15,7,5
Why?,Joey Tribbiani,10,15,7,6
Because patience is the road to understanding which ... is the key... to a happy heart.,Phoebe Buffay,10,15,7,7
You blow me away.,Joey Tribbiani,10,15,7,8
"All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?",Phoebe Buffay,10,15,7,9
"I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason.",Joey Tribbiani,10,15,7,10
And yet I never run into Beyonce!,Chandler Bing,10,15,8,2
"Don't, don't!",Chandler Bing,10,15,8,5
"No, actually, we're buying the house next door.",Monica Geller,10,15,8,6
Why!?,Chandler Bing,10,15,8,7
I don't know why.,Monica Geller,10,15,8,8
This can not be happening!,Chandler Bing,10,15,8,10
"Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.",Monica Geller,10,15,8,11
"The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.",Chandler Bing,10,15,8,12
"Okay, Okay, All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.",Monica Geller,10,15,8,13
"That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?",Chandler Bing,10,15,8,14
"Okay, you come up with an idea.",Monica Geller,10,15,8,15
"Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.",Chandler Bing,10,15,8,16
But we love our house.,Monica Geller,10,15,8,17
"Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and ""Oh My God""!",Chandler Bing,10,15,8,18
"Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.",Monica Geller,10,15,8,19
"Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. Oh, that does it too.",Chandler Bing,10,15,8,20
"It's me. Ron. Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.",Ross Geller,10,15,9,2
Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise?,Ross Geller,10,15,9,4
Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.,Ross Geller,10,15,9,6
Huh? So? We have a deal?,Ross Geller,10,15,9,8
Yes! yes!,Ross Geller,10,15,9,10
"Oh, Believe me, the ladies, they love it!",Ross Geller,10,15,9,12
"Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much.",Ross Geller,10,15,9,14
Oh my God. Hello?,Joey Tribbiani,10,15,10,2
"Joey, it's Estelle.",Phoebe Buffay,10,15,10,3
Estelle?,Joey Tribbiani,10,15,10,4
"Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me.",Phoebe Buffay,10,15,10,5
"Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?",Joey Tribbiani,10,15,10,6
"Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...",Phoebe Buffay,10,15,10,7
"No, no, no! Don't drop by, don't drop by!",Joey Tribbiani,10,15,10,8
"Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.",Phoebe Buffay,10,15,10,9
"Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?",Joey Tribbiani,10,15,10,10
"It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge.",Phoebe Buffay,10,15,10,11
"Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. ""out of area"". Boy, I'll say.",Joey Tribbiani,10,15,10,12
The Hitlers will be so disappointed.,Chandler Bing,10,15,11,2
Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.,Chandler Bing,10,15,11,4
Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.,Chandler Bing,10,15,11,6
I never stopped loving you.,Chandler Bing,10,15,11,8
"Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.",Chandler Bing,10,15,11,10
"Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.",Chandler Bing,10,15,11,12
Obviously.,Chandler Bing,10,15,11,14
Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.,Chandler Bing,10,15,11,16
I understand.,Chandler Bing,10,15,11,18
They're never coming down now.,Chandler Bing,10,15,11,20

Hey!,Ross Geller,10,15,12,2
You are never going to believe what happened to me today.,Rachel Green,10,15,12,3

Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.,Rachel Green,10,15,12,5
They did?,Ross Geller,10,15,12,6
Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in.,Rachel Green,10,15,12,7
"So, what are you gonna do?",Ross Geller,10,15,12,8
"Well, I took it.",Rachel Green,10,15,12,9
That's great! So you're staying in New York!,Ross Geller,10,15,12,10
"You're excited, right?",Ross Geller,10,15,12,12
"Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice...",Rachel Green,10,15,12,13
Right!,Ross Geller,10,15,12,14
"Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can...",Rachel Green,10,15,12,15
"Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.",Ross Geller,10,15,12,16
"Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good.",Rachel Green,10,15,12,17
You should go.,Ross Geller,10,15,12,18

Then I'm happy too.,Ross Geller,10,15,12,30
"Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. Dude, where's my speech? That is entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody.",Joey Tribbiani,10,15,13,1
"All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.",Joey Tribbiani,10,16,1,1
"Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.",Rachel Green,10,16,1,2

"Oh, that sounds good!",Rachel Green,10,16,1,9
"Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?",Monica Geller,10,16,1,10
It's all done!,Rachel Green,10,16,1,11
"Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.",Monica Geller,10,16,1,12
"I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...",Rachel Green,10,16,1,13
"Ok, so you've done some good work! What about your carry-ons?",Monica Geller,10,16,1,14
"Oh, well. Everything that I need is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.",Rachel Green,10,16,1,15
Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!,Monica Geller,10,16,1,16

"Here, let me help you.",Monica Geller,10,16,1,21
"Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!",Rachel Green,10,16,1,22
At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport? OPENING SEQUENCE.,Chandler Bing,10,16,1,23
"Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?",Monica Geller,10,16,2,1
"You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?",Monica Geller,10,16,2,3

She brought them up! I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!,Ross Geller,10,16,2,13
"Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.",Monica Geller,10,16,2,15
Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?,Ross Geller,10,16,2,16
Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.,Monica Geller,10,16,2,17
"Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...",Ross Geller,10,16,2,19
Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.,Monica Geller,10,16,2,20
"Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.",Ross Geller,10,16,2,22
"Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.",Monica Geller,10,16,2,23
"No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?",Ross Geller,10,16,2,24
"Yeah, it takes two incomes.",Monica Geller,10,16,2,25
"Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.",Ross Geller,10,16,2,26
"Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.",Monica Geller,10,16,2,27

"Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.",Rachel Green,10,16,5,1
"Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents, but I do have something for you.",Phoebe Buffay,10,16,5,2
"Oh, oh. . What is this?",Rachel Green,10,16,5,3
"It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!",Phoebe Buffay,10,16,5,4
"I'm gonna throw this away, but thank you so much for the gesture!",Rachel Green,10,16,5,5
Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these on my pillow.,Monica Geller,10,16,6,1
"Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!",Chandler Bing,10,16,6,2
What are you talking about? These aren't mine.,Monica Geller,10,16,6,3
"Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!",Chandler Bing,10,16,6,4

She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.,Phoebe Buffay,10,16,6,23
Are you kidding? Oh my God...,Ross Geller,10,16,6,24
"Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.",Phoebe Buffay,10,16,6,25
"Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this. Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.",Ross Geller,10,16,6,26
"Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...",Rachel Green,10,16,7,1
I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.,Monica Geller,10,16,7,2
I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...,Rachel Green,10,16,7,3
You're the best friend I ever had.,Monica Geller,10,16,7,4
What?,Monica Geller,10,16,7,6
I... I... I...,Rachel Green,10,16,7,7
That is so sweet.,Monica Geller,10,16,7,8
"Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.",Ross Geller,10,16,8,1
"Uh, Rach?",Chandler Bing,10,16,8,2
Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.,Ross Geller,10,16,8,3
I really made you think about that thing uh?,Joey Tribbiani,10,16,8,4
"Uh, Rach... I think I have something that belongs to you.",Chandler Bing,10,16,8,5
"Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.",Rachel Green,10,16,8,6
"No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.",Chandler Bing,10,16,8,7
"Well, these aren't mine. Maybe Monica used to use them with...",Rachel Green,10,16,8,8
"Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?",Chandler Bing,10,16,8,9
"Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.",Rachel Green,10,16,8,10

Yeah!,Phoebe Buffay,10,16,8,12
I think these are yours.,Chandler Bing,10,16,8,13
"These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.",Phoebe Buffay,10,16,8,14
Can I talk to you alone for a minute?,Rachel Green,10,16,8,15
Sure. You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?,Chandler Bing,10,16,8,16
Where do you think Mike really is?,Phoebe Buffay,10,16,8,17
Oh honey...,Rachel Green,10,16,9,1
"Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.",Chandler Bing,10,16,9,2
"Oh, you know what? Let's not say anything else. I love you.",Rachel Green,10,16,9,3
"Ooh, not so tight... I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.",Chandler Bing,10,16,9,4
Okay. Oh...,Rachel Green,10,16,9,5

"I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.",Chandler Bing,10,16,9,7
"So, I guess you're next. You're ready?",Monica Geller,10,16,10,1
I don't think so.,Ross Geller,10,16,10,2
"Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.",Chandler Bing,10,16,10,3
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.,Monica Geller,10,16,10,4
That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.,Chandler Bing,10,16,10,5
God! I can't believe she saved me for last. Why are they taking so long?,Ross Geller,10,16,10,6
"I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.",Phoebe Buffay,10,16,10,7
"Okay, here we go...",Ross Geller,10,16,10,9
Oh... Well...,Rachel Green,10,16,10,10
Yeah...,Ross Geller,10,16,10,11
I think I'm gonna take off.,Rachel Green,10,16,10,12
Huh?,Ross Geller,10,16,10,13
"Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.",Rachel Green,10,16,10,14
What? I don't get a goodbye?,Ross Geller,10,16,10,15
Lucky bastard!,Joey Tribbiani,10,16,10,16
Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.,Ross Geller,10,16,11,1
"Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.",Monica Geller,10,16,11,2
"Well, it needs to be plicit.",Ross Geller,10,16,11,3
"All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?",Joey Tribbiani,10,16,11,4
"No, I don't think so.",Ross Geller,10,16,11,5
"You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.",Phoebe Buffay,10,16,11,6
Yeah. Mine too.,Monica Geller,10,16,11,7
Mine was a humdinger.,Chandler Bing,10,16,11,8
"O-kay... I mean, don't I deserve anything? I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug? NOT FROM YOU!",Ross Geller,10,16,11,9
"Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.",Phoebe Buffay,10,16,11,10
"And say what? ""You owe me a goodbye"", I mean, he's got more pride than that.",Monica Geller,10,16,11,11
THE HELL I DO!,Ross Geller,10,16,11,12
I don't get a goodbye?,Ross Geller,10,16,11,13
What?,Rachel Green,10,16,11,14
"Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.",Ross Geller,10,16,11,15
Ross...,Rachel Green,10,16,11,16
"Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit. Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people. Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... IT'S PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe this is how you want to leave things between us. Have a, have a good time in Paris.",Ross Geller,10,16,11,17
I hope Ross isn't too upset.,Monica Geller,10,16,12,1
I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.,Joey Tribbiani,10,16,12,2
Tell me about it.,Phoebe Buffay,10,16,12,3
"Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.",Chandler Bing,10,16,12,4
"All right, I think I'm gonna head out.",Phoebe Buffay,10,16,12,5
"Uh, where do you think you're going?",Monica Geller,10,16,12,6
"I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.",Phoebe Buffay,10,16,12,7
We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.,Monica Geller,10,16,12,8
Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.,Chandler Bing,10,16,12,9
"Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.",Joey Tribbiani,10,16,12,10
Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.,Monica Geller,10,16,12,11
You couldn't be cool.,Chandler Bing,10,16,12,12
"Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?",Monica Geller,10,16,12,13
"Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.",Monica Geller,10,16,12,15
"Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.",Chandler Bing,10,16,12,16
You did? How?,Monica Geller,10,16,12,17
"Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.",Chandler Bing,10,16,12,18
Oh my God! Let me see.,Monica Geller,10,16,12,19
Who's that dirty old lady?,Joey Tribbiani,10,16,12,20
Monica's grandmother.,Chandler Bing,10,16,12,21
Nana liked it rough!,Monica Geller,10,16,12,22
"Come on here, have a seat.",Joey Tribbiani,10,16,12,25
How was your night?,Phoebe Buffay,10,16,12,26
"Erica, are you okay?",Monica Geller,10,16,12,28
Oh my God!,Monica Geller,10,16,12,30
Relax! We just get her some antacids.,Chandler Bing,10,16,12,31
"She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.",Monica Geller,10,16,12,32
Oh my God!,Chandler Bing,10,16,12,33
"Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.",Phoebe Buffay,10,16,12,34
"All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh!",Monica Geller,10,16,12,35
"Honey, it's gonna be okay.",Chandler Bing,10,16,12,36
"Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.",Monica Geller,10,16,12,38
"Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.",Monica Geller,10,16,12,40
"Chandler, wait, wait, wait...",Joey Tribbiani,10,16,12,41
What?,Chandler Bing,10,16,12,42
"If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.",Joey Tribbiani,10,16,12,43
You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?,Rachel Green,10,16,13,1
That's what it seemed like.,Ross Geller,10,16,13,2
"I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.",Rachel Green,10,16,13,3
"Fine, then why didn't you say something?",Ross Geller,10,16,13,4
"Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!",Rachel Green,10,16,13,5
Rach!,Ross Geller,10,16,13,6
What?,Rachel Green,10,16,13,7
"You keep, you keep... You can't...",Ross Geller,10,16,13,8
WHAT?,Rachel Green,10,16,13,9
A little more.,Joey Tribbiani,10,16,14,1

"All right, ready?",Phoebe Buffay,10,16,14,4
"Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.",Joey Tribbiani,10,16,14,5
"All right, here it goes...",Phoebe Buffay,10,16,14,6
Doesn't work...,Joey Tribbiani,10,16,14,7
"Erica, are you okay?",Monica Geller,10,17,1,2
Oh my God!,Monica Geller,10,17,1,4
Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.,Chandler Bing,10,17,1,5
She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!,Monica Geller,10,17,1,6
Oh my God!,Chandler Bing,10,17,1,7
"So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me.",Rachel Green,10,17,1,8
Rach!,Ross Geller,10,17,1,9
What?!,Rachel Green,10,17,1,10
Hey.,Ross Geller,10,17,2,1
Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.,Rachel Green,10,17,2,2
Oh. This was amazing.,Ross Geller,10,17,2,3
It really was. You've learned some new moves!,Rachel Green,10,17,2,4
"Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me ""Sex for Dummies"" as a joke.",Ross Geller,10,17,2,5
Ah.,Rachel Green,10,17,2,6
Who's laughing now?,Ross Geller,10,17,2,7
I know!,Rachel Green,10,17,2,8
"Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.",Monica Geller,10,17,3,1
"Next time, can I say breathe?",Chandler Bing,10,17,3,2
"No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?",Monica Geller,10,17,3,3
"Alright, I'll be right back.",Monica Geller,10,17,3,5
Where are you going?,Chandler Bing,10,17,3,6
To use the bathroom.,Monica Geller,10,17,3,7
You can't leave me alone with her.,Chandler Bing,10,17,3,8
What?,Monica Geller,10,17,3,9
This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!,Chandler Bing,10,17,3,10
What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?,Monica Geller,10,17,3,11
"It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.",Chandler Bing,10,17,3,12
"You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.",Monica Geller,10,17,3,13
Okay.,Chandler Bing,10,17,3,14
"So, ah... Any plans for the summer?",Chandler Bing,10,17,3,15
"Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?",Chandler Bing,10,17,3,17
"Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.",Chandler Bing,10,17,3,19
"One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.",Chandler Bing,10,17,3,20
Morning.,Phoebe Buffay,10,17,4,1
Hey!,Joey Tribbiani,10,17,4,2
What's that?,Phoebe Buffay,10,17,4,3
It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.,Joey Tribbiani,10,17,4,4
It's a baby chick and duck!,Phoebe Buffay,10,17,4,5
Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.,Joey Tribbiani,10,17,4,6
I did not see that coming.,Phoebe Buffay,10,17,4,7
"Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.",Joey Tribbiani,10,17,4,8
Yes.,Phoebe Buffay,10,17,4,9
Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.,Joey Tribbiani,10,17,4,10
"That is the rule, though.",Phoebe Buffay,10,17,4,11
Guess what? You're almost an uncle!,Phoebe Buffay,10,17,4,12

Have you seen him throw a ball?,Phoebe Buffay,10,17,4,18
Is Rachel here?,Ross Geller,10,17,4,19

"Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.",Ross Geller,10,17,4,21
What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?,Phoebe Buffay,10,17,4,22
"Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!",Ross Geller,10,17,4,23
Oh my God. You and Rachel?,Joey Tribbiani,10,17,4,24
"I know, it's pretty great.",Ross Geller,10,17,4,25
So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?,Joey Tribbiani,10,17,4,26
"Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.",Ross Geller,10,17,4,27
But do you wanna get back together?,Phoebe Buffay,10,17,4,28
"I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.",Ross Geller,10,17,4,29
YAY!,Phoebe Buffay,10,17,4,30

"Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical! ""Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And the moon comes...""",Phoebe Buffay,10,17,4,35
Morning!,Rachel Green,10,17,4,36
Guess we'll never know how it ends.,Phoebe Buffay,10,17,4,37

You really think so?,Ross Geller,10,17,7,10
