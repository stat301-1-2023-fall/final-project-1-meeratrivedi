Carol Willick,1,2,2,13,So.
Carol Willick,1,2,2,15,Sorry. You look good too.
Carol Willick,1,2,2,17,A lesbian?
Carol Willick,1,2,2,19,"Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-"
Carol Willick,1,2,2,21,I'm pregnant.
Judy Geller,1,2,4,1,"Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. Mmm! What's that curry taste?"
Judy Geller,1,2,4,3,Mmmm!
Judy Geller,1,2,4,6,They all had a thing for him.
Judy Geller,1,2,4,9,"Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-"
Judy Geller,1,2,4,11,"Well, they don't have to know that..."
Judy Geller,1,2,4,14,"Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy."
Judy Geller,1,2,4,17,"What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well."
Judy Geller,1,2,4,19,"Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar..."
Judy Geller,1,2,4,21,Nothing! It's an expression.
Judy Geller,1,2,4,31,And you knew about this?!
Carol Willick,1,2,6,4,"Ross, you remember Susan."
Carol Willick,1,2,6,8,Dr. Oberman.
Carol Willick,1,2,6,12,"Yes, and she's very supportive."
Carol Willick,1,2,6,14,Thanks.
Carol Willick,1,2,6,16,Ross? That opens my cervix.
Carol Willick,1,2,8,2,Give me a 'for instance'.
Carol Willick,1,2,8,4,Marlon-
Carol Willick,1,2,8,6,"-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl."
Carol Willick,1,2,8,8,As in my grandmother.
Carol Willick,1,2,8,10,Julia..
Carol Willick,1,2,10,3,Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
Carol Willick,1,2,10,5,"No, I mean it's not Geller."
Carol Willick,1,2,10,7,"No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch."
Carol Willick,1,2,10,12,"All right, you two, stop it!"
Carol Willick,1,2,10,14,Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.
Carol Willick,1,2,10,25,I know.
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,5,6,9,"Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day."
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,5,6,11,"We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping... ... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you..."
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,5,6,14,What?
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,5,6,16,I got you...these.
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,5,6,18,"Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want."
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,5,6,22,"No, no, I'm still working on mine."
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,5,11,4,"All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it."
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,5,14,2,Ow!
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,5,14,4,"Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back."
Judy Geller,1,8,3,4,"Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?"
Judy Geller,1,8,3,6,What's different?
Judy Geller,1,8,3,8,"Oh, maybe that's it."
Judy Geller,1,8,3,29,What is going on?!
Judy Geller,1,8,3,31,What?
Judy Geller,1,8,5,2,"Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!"
Judy Geller,1,8,5,4,"Sweetie, you think you can get in there?"
Judy Geller,1,8,8,5,You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
Judy Geller,1,8,8,10,That's really a day shoe.
Judy Geller,1,8,8,15,Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
Judy Geller,1,8,8,19,"Is everything all right, dear?"
Judy Geller,1,8,10,2,"It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream."
Judy Geller,1,8,11,6,"Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident."
Judy Geller,1,8,11,34,Your grandmother would have hated this.
Judy Geller,1,8,11,36,"No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'."
Judy Geller,1,8,11,38,Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
Judy Geller,1,8,11,40,"I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is."
Judy Geller,1,8,11,42,Tell her what?
Judy Geller,1,8,11,44,I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
Judy Geller,1,8,11,46,...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.
Judy Geller,1,8,11,48,"More wine, dear?"
Judy Geller,1,8,11,50,Those earrings look really lovely on you.
Judy Geller,1,8,11,52,Actually they were Nana's.
Carol Willick,1,9,9,1,Anytime you're ready.
Carol Willick,1,9,9,3,Just aim for the bump.
Carol Willick,1,9,9,5,"So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it."
Carol Willick,1,9,11,2,"Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want."
Carol Willick,1,9,11,7,I did.
Carol Willick,1,9,11,9,"No, no that was the first."
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,10,7,1,"I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,10,7,29,"There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,10,7,31,"Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,10,7,41,"Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter."
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,10,7,43,"Oh, no. Oh, no."
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,10,7,45,"Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me."
Carol Willick,1,12,4,1,"Hey hey, come on in!"
Carol Willick,1,12,4,4,"Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat."
Carol Willick,1,12,4,6,"So, I got the results of the amnio today."
Carol Willick,1,12,4,8,Totally and completely healthy!
Carol Willick,1,12,4,11,"Uh, that's our friend Tanya."
Carol Willick,1,12,4,13,Don't you want to know about the sex?
Carol Willick,1,12,4,15,"The sex of the baby, Ross."
Carol Willick,1,12,4,17,Do you want to know?
Carol Willick,1,12,4,25,"Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be..."
Carol Willick,1,12,4,28,Mm-hmmm
Carol Willick,1,12,4,32,"Well, thanks for the books."
Carol Willick,1,12,4,35,Hello?
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,3,8,Oh.... my.... God.
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,6,3,"By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads."
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,6,5,"Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty."
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,6,21,Just us.
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,6,23,"Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom."
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,6,25,"So, do we have the best friends or what?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,6,27,I will go for that drink.
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,6,29,Each.
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,7,1,Happy Valentine's Day!
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,8,1,"Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,8,3,Kiss me!
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,8,8,"Hi, Monica."
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,8,19,This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,8,22,"Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,11,5,"Hello, funny Valentine."
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,11,7,"Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!"
Carol Willick,1,14,12,3,Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
Carol Willick,1,14,12,8,"Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine."
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,14,1,I brought you something.
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,14,3,I had them made special.
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,14,5,That's fine.
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,14,7,Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,14,9,"No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing."
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,14,11,Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,14,13,"You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya."
Carol Willick,1,14,15,1,It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
Carol Willick,1,14,15,3,"Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone."
Carol Willick,1,14,15,5,That could be it.
Carol Willick,1,14,15,7,"Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny"
Carol Willick,1,14,15,10,"Oh, I love you too. But..."
Carol Willick,1,14,15,12,"You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you."
Carol Willick,1,14,15,14,All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
Carol Willick,1,14,15,16,Not her.
Carol Willick,1,16,3,6,Life partner.
Carol Willick,1,16,3,11,Susan and I live together.
Carol Willick,1,16,3,15,Its a little complicated.
Frank Buffay Jr.,1,16,9,8,"Look, youre cold, I have to pee, and... ..theres a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,1,16,9,11,Whats she doing here?
Frank Buffay Jr.,1,16,9,13,Think she got fired at Riffs?
Frank Buffay Jr.,1,16,9,15,"Im gonna wait till after we order. Its her, right."
Frank Buffay Jr.,1,16,9,25,Err... we know what we want.
Frank Buffay Jr.,1,16,9,28,And some biscottie cookies.
Frank Buffay Jr.,1,16,9,32,Yeah.
Carol Willick,1,16,12,6,This is impossible. Its just impossible.
Carol Willick,1,16,12,8,"What that woman... did. I am not doin that. Its just gonna have to stay in, thats all, everything will be the same, itll just stay in."
Carol Willick,1,16,12,10,"Oh, what do you know? No one's going up to you and saying, ""Hi, is that your nostril? Mind if we push this pot roast through it?"""
Carol Willick,1,23,1,22,"I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky."
Carol Willick,1,23,2,2,"Let it go, Ross."
Carol Willick,1,23,2,9,"Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus."
Carol Willick,1,23,2,13,Am I allowed to drink anything?
Carol Willick,1,23,2,20,Thanks.
Carol Willick,1,23,6,7,You're gonna kill me!
Carol Willick,1,23,6,9,Count faster.
Carol Willick,1,23,6,14,"Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie."
Carol Willick,1,23,6,16,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp."
Carol Willick,1,23,6,21,"All right, that's it. I want both of you out."
Carol Willick,1,23,6,26,"I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier."
Carol Willick,1,23,6,28,Now go!
Carol Willick,1,23,6,32,Out!
Carol Willick,1,23,10,1,Are they here yet?
Carol Willick,1,23,10,3,Ok.
Carol Willick,1,23,10,5,Ok.
Carol Willick,1,23,17,1,Where are they?
Carol Willick,1,23,17,10,But they're not here yet!
Carol Willick,1,23,17,12,"Oh, god."
Carol Willick,1,23,19,3,Where have you been?
Carol Willick,1,23,19,13,Not.... helping!
Carol Willick,1,23,19,19,What does he look like?
Carol Willick,1,23,19,21,Really?
Carol Willick,1,23,20,4,Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?
Frank Buffay Jr.,2,1,9,2,How long do you want the cuffs?
Frank Buffay Jr.,2,1,9,4,"I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam."
Carol Willick,2,2,1,5,I guess so.
Carol Willick,2,2,1,15,Sure.
Carol Willick,2,2,1,17,"It did at first, but not anymore."
Carol Willick,2,2,1,20,As much as he needs.
Carol Willick,2,2,6,2,"Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep."
Carol Willick,2,2,9,4,How did we do?
Carol Willick,2,2,9,7,Why'd you freak out?
Carol Willick,2,2,9,9,My breast milk is gross?
Carol Willick,2,2,9,13,"Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it."
Janice Litman Goralnik,2,3,8,30,"Oh, my, god."
Janice Litman Goralnik,2,3,8,35,Helloo!!
Janice Litman Goralnik,2,3,8,38,"Hey, it's everybody."
Janice Litman Goralnik,2,3,8,40,"Yes, I am."
Janice Litman Goralnik,2,3,8,42,"Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now."
Janice Litman Goralnik,2,3,8,44,"Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry."
Janice Litman Goralnik,2,3,8,46,And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.
Carol Willick,2,11,1,3,So how did everything go?
Carol Willick,2,11,1,5,"Well, we've gotta go."
Carol Willick,2,11,1,8,"Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us."
Carol Willick,2,11,1,10,"Uh, no, Susan and me."
Carol Willick,2,11,1,13,"We're uh, we're getting married."
Carol Willick,2,11,1,15,"Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to."
Carol Willick,2,11,1,17,Look I just thought that...
Carol Willick,2,11,1,21,Want us to go?
Carol Willick,2,11,7,3,How's it going?
Carol Willick,2,11,7,5,"Fine, whatever."
Carol Willick,2,11,7,7,"Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding."
Carol Willick,2,11,7,11,My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.
Carol Willick,2,11,7,13,"I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything."
Carol Willick,2,11,7,15,"And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do."
Carol Willick,2,11,7,17,You do?
Carol Willick,2,11,7,19,Of course I do.
Carol Willick,2,11,7,21,You're right. Of course you're right.
Carol Willick,2,11,7,23,We're back on.
Carol Willick,2,11,8,5,Thank you.
Carol Willick,2,11,8,7,Ross.
Judy Geller,2,14,4,4,Hi darling.
Judy Geller,2,14,4,7,"Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym."
Judy Geller,2,14,4,11,"Oh, hi Rachel."
Judy Geller,2,14,4,13,"Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear."
Judy Geller,2,14,8,4,"Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him?"
Judy Geller,2,14,8,7,"Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up."
Judy Geller,2,14,8,13,Why?
Judy Geller,2,14,8,15,You were fired? What're you gonna do?
Judy Geller,2,14,10,14,"Over here Jack. OK. I see, Rachel's coming up the path. Oh doesn't she look pretty. Jack, get this."
Judy Geller,2,14,10,23,Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.
Judy Geller,2,14,10,57,I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.
Judy Geller,2,14,10,59,"Jack, give me that. Talk to your son."
Judy Geller,2,14,10,72,"Ahh, are you hadsome."
Judy Geller,2,14,10,77,"Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?"
Judy Geller,2,14,10,79,"Which one? Which button, Jack."
Judy Geller,2,14,11,2,Dance with him.
Judy Geller,2,14,11,4,Dance with your father.
Judy Geller,2,14,11,7,"Oh, Jack."
Richard Burke,2,15,3,4,"Ah, that's OK, come on in. Um, I'm sorry, is Monica Geller coming? I was told she was."
Richard Burke,2,15,3,6,"Monica? My God you used to be so. . . I mean you, you, you, you must have lost like. . . You look great."
Richard Burke,2,15,3,8,"Hi Phoebe, nice to meet you. So, how ya been?"
Richard Burke,2,15,3,10,"Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt."
Richard Burke,2,15,3,12,"Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. 'How ya doin'? You OK?'"
Richard Burke,2,15,3,14,"No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. 'I'm OK.' 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change."
Richard Burke,2,15,3,16,I'll survive.
Richard Burke,2,15,5,3,"But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists."
Richard Burke,2,15,5,5,"Only because my parents wanted me to be, I wanted to be a sherrif."
Richard Burke,2,15,5,7,See.
Richard Burke,2,15,5,9,"OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this. Who needs glasses?"
Richard Burke,2,15,8,2,I'm going to look into your eyes now.
Richard Burke,2,15,8,4,"Yeah, that's my job. Alright, look up. . . look down, now open your eyes, now look down. That's right, look into the light. Now look at me. . . OK. Your eyes look good. Those are good eyes."
Richard Burke,2,15,8,6,"So, it's great to see ya."
Richard Burke,2,15,8,8,You too.
Richard Burke,2,15,8,10,Drops!
Richard Burke,2,15,8,12,"Drops. Here, they're free."
Richard Burke,2,15,8,14,"Oh, OK, yeah. I'll see ya later."
Richard Burke,2,15,11,3,Yep.
Richard Burke,2,15,11,5,"Ya know, she's having another baby."
Richard Burke,2,15,11,7,"No no. Henry's almost two and he's talking and everyting. Here. You know, the other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa. Now in all fairness his other grandpa's a drunk but still. . ."
Richard Burke,2,15,11,9,Yeah. Are we nuts here?
Richard Burke,2,15,11,11,"I didn't need to know that. I guess 21 years is a lot. I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you."
Richard Burke,2,15,11,13,So.
Richard Burke,2,15,11,15,"Yeah, yeah, maybe."
Richard Burke,2,15,11,17,"Yeah, it sure does."
Richard Burke,2,15,11,19,"No, no, there's no rush or anything."
Judy Geller,2,16,3,5,Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
Richard Burke,2,16,3,9,Happy birthday.
Judy Geller,2,16,3,10,"Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?"
Judy Geller,2,16,4,3,"No, Richard Burke gave them a ride."
Judy Geller,2,16,4,6,"Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section."
Judy Geller,2,16,4,8,We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
Richard Burke,2,16,6,4,I am not telling you guys anything.
Richard Burke,2,16,6,8,"Jack, would you let it go?"
Richard Burke,2,16,6,10,"Guys. Seriously, it is not like that."
Richard Burke,2,16,8,2,How ya doin'?
Richard Burke,2,16,8,4,Really? I'm a hero.
Richard Burke,2,16,8,6,"Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them."
Richard Burke,2,16,8,8,My parents are dead.
Richard Burke,2,16,8,10,"I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright."
Richard Burke,2,16,8,12,"Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you."
Judy Geller,2,16,8,13,"Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support."
Judy Geller,2,16,8,15,I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
Judy Geller,2,16,8,17,I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
Judy Geller,2,16,8,19,Really.
Judy Geller,2,16,8,21,"So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?"
Judy Geller,2,16,8,23,Oh Jack stop.
Judy Geller,2,16,10,3,Almost time for cake.
Richard Burke,2,16,11,3,What?
Richard Burke,2,16,11,5,"Humm, really?"
Judy Geller,2,16,11,6,Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?
Richard Burke,2,16,11,7,"Uhh, not that I know of."
Judy Geller,2,16,11,8,"Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?"
Richard Burke,2,16,11,9,That - that's an idea.
Judy Geller,2,16,11,11,Oh?
Richard Burke,2,16,11,12,Oh?
Judy Geller,2,16,11,14,"She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?"
Judy Geller,2,16,11,16,"So, who's the mystery man?"
Judy Geller,2,16,11,18,A real doctor?
Judy Geller,2,16,11,20,Well that's wonderful. . . I
Richard Burke,2,16,11,22,It is Judy.
Judy Geller,2,16,11,23,Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!
Judy Geller,2,16,11,26,It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.
Richard Burke,2,16,11,30,She's not a twinkie.
Judy Geller,2,16,11,32,"Oh please, a relationship."
Richard Burke,2,16,11,34,Really?
Richard Burke,2,16,14,3,"No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running."
Richard Burke,2,16,14,10,Very tasteful.
Richard Burke,2,16,14,15,What're we looking at? That blue freckle?
Richard Burke,2,18,4,3,"Phoebe's got another job, right?"
Richard Burke,2,18,4,7,"Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring."
Richard Burke,2,18,4,9,"I don't know, I don't have my jammies."
Richard Burke,2,18,4,14,"Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet."
Richard Burke,2,18,4,16,"Hear that? She likes me best, and apparently there've been a lot."
Richard Burke,2,18,9,5,Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
Richard Burke,2,18,9,7,Two.
Richard Burke,2,18,9,9,"Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two."
Richard Burke,2,18,9,11,"Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark."
Richard Burke,2,18,11,2,That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
Richard Burke,2,18,11,4,"Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet."
Richard Burke,2,18,11,6,"Oh honey, I'm fine."
Richard Burke,2,18,11,8,"What? Alright, what about my two?"
Richard Burke,2,18,11,10,"Right, and..."
Richard Burke,2,18,11,12,"Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with."
Richard Burke,2,18,11,14,Right.
Richard Burke,2,18,11,16,Now I do.
Richard Burke,2,18,11,33,Monica.
Richard Burke,2,18,11,36,Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting.
Richard Burke,2,18,11,38,No.
Richard Burke,2,18,11,40,I have a little comb.
Richard Burke,2,18,11,42,A moustache comb.
Richard Burke,2,18,11,54,"No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs."
Richard Burke,2,18,11,58,Shall we?
Richard Burke,2,18,11,60,"Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand..."
Richard Burke,2,18,15,4,Hey.
Richard Burke,2,18,15,6,"Ohh, brisk tonight."
Richard Burke,2,18,15,8,Let's never speak of this.
Richard Burke,2,20,1,3,Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.
Richard Burke,2,20,1,14,"Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen."
Richard Burke,2,20,2,12,"Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan."
Richard Burke,2,20,2,14,Glad to be of help. Matches.
Carol Willick,2,20,3,3,Hello
Carol Willick,2,20,3,6,Hi honey.
Carol Willick,2,20,3,8,What?
Carol Willick,2,20,3,11,"Uhh, we know, he already did it last week."
Carol Willick,2,20,3,14,"Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen."
Richard Burke,2,20,4,24,"Hey, you're gettin' better. I'm gonna keep this by the way."
Carol Willick,2,20,5,3,"Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg."
Carol Willick,2,20,5,6,Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.
Richard Burke,2,20,7,3,"Hey Phoebs, what's happening?"
Richard Burke,2,20,7,7,Charlotte who?
Richard Burke,2,20,7,15,"Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?"
Richard Burke,2,20,7,18,"Hey, be right there."
Richard Burke,2,20,7,21,It's the basketball playoffs.
Richard Burke,2,20,7,23,"Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'"
Richard Burke,2,20,7,25,"Uh, it's the college playoffs."
Richard Burke,2,20,7,27,"Uh, they're not in it."
Richard Burke,2,20,7,29,Ok.
Richard Burke,2,20,9,3,"But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?"
Richard Burke,2,20,9,5,"Well, we had a table in college."
Richard Burke,2,20,9,7,Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.
Richard Burke,2,20,9,9,"Ok, just one more point."
Richard Burke,2,20,9,12,Is everything all right?
Richard Burke,2,20,9,14,Uh-oh.
Richard Burke,2,20,9,17,Well.
Richard Burke,2,20,9,19,"Uh, you guys see me as a dad?"
Richard Burke,2,20,9,24,"Uh-huh, yeah."
Richard Burke,2,20,9,26,"That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around."
Richard Burke,2,20,9,32,"Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys."
Richard Burke,2,20,9,34,"What're you talkin' about, I was killin' 'em."
Carol Willick,2,20,10,5,It's us.
Carol Willick,2,20,10,18,What did he say?
Carol Willick,2,20,10,21,Mommy is so proud of you. Hi. Hi.
Carol Willick,2,20,10,23,Hi.
Carol Willick,2,20,10,25,Hi.
Carol Willick,2,20,10,27,Hi.
Carol Willick,2,20,10,29,Hi.
Carol Willick,2,20,10,31,We've got a cab waiting downstairs.
Carol Willick,2,20,10,33,Tuesday.
Carol Willick,2,20,10,40,"We've gotta go, we've got that cab waiting."
Frank Buffay Jr.,2,21,10,12,Yeah. What?
Frank Buffay Jr.,2,21,10,18,Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad?
Frank Buffay Jr.,2,21,10,20,Heavy.
Frank Buffay Jr.,2,21,10,22,No but he didn't really talk about anything.
Frank Buffay Jr.,2,21,10,24,Except stilts.
Frank Buffay Jr.,2,21,10,26,"Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts."
Frank Buffay Jr.,2,21,10,28,Yeah.
Frank Buffay Jr.,2,21,10,30,Me neither. So you're like my big sister.
Frank Buffay Jr.,2,21,10,32,"This is huge, you can buy me beer."
Frank Buffay Jr.,2,21,10,34,I gotta friend named Mark.
Frank Buffay Jr.,2,21,10,36,"Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'."
Frank Buffay Jr.,2,21,10,38,Alright.
Frank Buffay Jr.,2,21,10,40,"Ok, yeah."
Frank Buffay Jr.,2,21,10,42,"Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter."
Judy Geller,2,22,5,46,"Ross, whose glasses are those?"
Richard Burke,2,23,2,3,"Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown."
Richard Burke,2,23,2,4,"Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?"
Richard Burke,2,23,2,6,What're you doing?
Richard Burke,2,23,2,8,Are you remaking the bed?
Richard Burke,2,23,2,10,"Then, you're redoing it because..."
Richard Burke,2,23,2,12,You're pretty much running that risk either way.
Richard Burke,2,23,2,14,"Oh, well that's not so crazy."
Richard Burke,2,23,2,16,"Oh, alright."
Richard Burke,2,23,2,18,"Actually, if it's possible, I love you more."
Richard Burke,2,23,9,2,"Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?"
Richard Burke,2,23,9,4,You're strict.
Richard Burke,2,23,9,6,"You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time."
Richard Burke,2,23,9,8,"If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle."
Richard Burke,2,23,9,10,Thank you.
Richard Burke,2,23,9,12,You're gonna do what to my clocks.
Richard Burke,2,23,9,14,"Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time."
Richard Burke,2,23,9,16,Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
Richard Burke,2,23,9,18,No come on. Come on tell me.
Richard Burke,2,23,9,20,Come on.
Richard Burke,2,23,9,22,No that's not true. That is not true.
Richard Burke,2,23,9,24,Yeah.
Richard Burke,2,23,9,26,"Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks."
Richard Burke,2,23,9,28,"Boy I would just uh, I would freak out."
Richard Burke,2,23,9,30,"See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well."
Richard Burke,2,23,12,2,"Monica, wake up. Monica."
Richard Burke,2,23,12,4,I thought of a thing.
Richard Burke,2,23,12,6,"Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed."
Richard Burke,2,23,12,8,Or so I would have you believe.
Richard Burke,2,23,12,10,"Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet."
Richard Burke,2,23,12,12,"Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side."
Richard Burke,2,23,12,14,Yeah. How 'bout that.
Richard Burke,2,24,3,23,"Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later."
Richard Burke,2,24,3,26,"I love you, too."
Richard Burke,2,24,4,3,"Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out."
Richard Burke,2,24,4,5,Okay.
Richard Burke,2,24,4,7,Sure I do.
Richard Burke,2,24,4,9,"Honey, you are in it."
Richard Burke,2,24,4,11,"Oh, yeah!"
Richard Burke,2,24,4,13,"Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast."
Richard Burke,2,24,4,15,Like a hound?
Richard Burke,2,24,4,17,You really need the bassinet?
Richard Burke,2,24,4,19,"Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start."
Richard Burke,2,24,4,21,"Look I want you, now."
Richard Burke,2,24,6,3,"Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun."
Richard Burke,2,24,6,5,Neither am I.
Richard Burke,2,24,10,3,"Okay, last chance. Again, I'm sorry."
Richard Burke,2,24,11,2,"Okay, I'll do it."
Richard Burke,2,24,11,4,If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.
Richard Burke,2,24,11,6,"If I have to I'll, I'll do all again , I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, I'll go to the P.T.A. meetings, I'll coach the soccer team."
Richard Burke,2,24,11,8,"Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will."
Richard Burke,2,24,11,10,But you're not.
Richard Burke,2,24,11,12,God. I love you.
Richard Burke,2,24,11,14,I guess we just keep dancing.
Janice Litman Goralnik,2,24,12,8,OH.....MY.....GAWD!!
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,1,3,5,"Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. Good morning Joey."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,1,3,8,"Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,1,3,10,"I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,1,3,13,"I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,1,10,2,"So, I hear, you hate me!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,1,10,4,A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,1,10,6,"All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, We've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea you and me spending some quality time together."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,1,10,8,For Chandler!
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,1,10,10,Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!'
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,1,10,12,"Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,1,12,2,We're baack!
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,1,12,5,Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!!
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,1,12,8,"I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler."
Jack Geller,3,1,13,5,"Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. Since when did you start smoking cigars?"
Jack Geller,3,1,13,7,"Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay."
Jack Geller,3,1,13,9,I saw Richard.
Jack Geller,3,1,13,11,"So, how are you doing?"
Jack Geller,3,1,13,13,You don't wanna know.
Jack Geller,3,1,13,15,"Well, he's doing terrible!"
Jack Geller,3,1,13,17,Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
Jack Geller,3,1,13,19,"No, the man is a mess."
Jack Geller,3,1,13,21,No.
Jack Geller,3,1,13,23,Maybe.
Jack Geller,3,1,13,25,"Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However,"
Judy Geller,3,1,14,4,"Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here."
Richard Burke,3,2,2,48,"""Monica, it's Richard. Call me."""
Richard Burke,3,2,2,89,"""Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone."""
Richard Burke,3,2,3,141,"Hi, this is Richard."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,3,6,2,Night-night Bing-a-ling.
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,3,9,3,"Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,3,9,5,"Oh, I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,3,9,7,"You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,4,2,3,"Well, let's go to a bad one and make out."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,4,2,16,What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.
Carol Willick,3,4,3,4,"He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it."
Carol Willick,3,4,3,8,"This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,4,5,2,"So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,4,5,4,"Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,4,5,6,"Oh, you didn't have to do this."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,4,5,8,"Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,4,5,10,We should?
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,4,5,12,"I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,4,5,14,You probably want us to move in together?
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,4,5,16,"Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um..."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,4,8,2,"No, thank you. Chandler!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,4,8,4,What are you doing here?
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,4,8,6,Are you being British?!
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,4,8,8,Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,4,8,10,Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,4,8,12,Where is this party?
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,4,8,14,Who's party is it?
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,4,8,16,What woman?!
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,4,8,18,"Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?"
Carol Willick,3,4,11,2,G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!
Carol Willick,3,4,11,16,"Oh please God, let there be a song."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,3,26,How are you?

Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,3,44,"Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars. And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,6,3,What?
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,6,5,"What, wait, you mean like this?"

Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,10,8,"Wow! That's wild! No, I had no idea."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,10,10,You mean like watch?
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,10,12,"Well, I don't think this, y'know."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,10,14,"Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,12,2,"Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!"
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,12,4,She broke my arm.
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,12,6,"No, she touched mine first!"
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,12,8,"So wait, what's the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I can't touch you?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,12,12,"No, your a masseuse, it's cool, I'm not a cop."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,12,16,"Wait that's-that's, what that's not what you do?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,12,18,"I don't know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I mean, I don't know."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,12,20,"Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can't believe that I screwed it up so bad."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,12,22,"Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn't perfect, but y'know it was pretty cool, y'know, 'cause we had all those great talks y'know."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,12,24,"Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my likes and my dislikes..."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,12,26,"How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,12,28,"Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you 'cause y'know you're my sister, y'know."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,12,30,Then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me.
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,12,32,"You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,12,34,This?
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,12,36,"Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I almost got arm broken by a hooker..."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,5,12,38,"Well, when I tell my friends about her she will be."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,6,1,2,Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you?
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,6,1,5,"Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,6,1,7,I'm sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,6,1,12,"Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,7,2,9,"Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,7,2,12,"Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,7,16,10,Oh my God.
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,8,7,2,How's my Bing-a-ling?
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,8,7,4,Why are your eyes so white?
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,8,7,6,Oh my God!!

Janice Litman Goralnik,3,8,7,17,The receipt.
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,8,7,19,I don't know.
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,8,11,3,Okay.
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,8,11,5,Wow!
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,8,11,7,"Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say 'good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,8,11,9,What?
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,8,11,11,"No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I've got to give my marriage another chance."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,8,11,13,I'm sorry.
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,8,11,15,"No, I-I-I gotta go."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,8,11,17,"Honey, honey, people are looking."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,8,11,19,"Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now."
Janice Litman Goralnik,3,8,11,21,Good-bye Chandler Bing.
Richard Burke,3,13,1,8,I can help with that.
Richard Burke,3,13,1,10,Hi!
Richard Burke,3,13,1,12,"So, you look great."
Richard Burke,3,13,1,14,No you do. You... just...
Richard Burke,3,13,1,16,You've got panties stuck to your leg.
Richard Burke,3,13,1,18,It's good to see you.
Richard Burke,3,13,2,3,"He's gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy. This is nice."
Richard Burke,3,13,2,5,I missed this.
Richard Burke,3,13,2,7,"So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?"
Richard Burke,3,13,2,9,"Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise."
Richard Burke,3,13,2,11,"No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven."
Richard Burke,3,13,6,2,"So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?"
Richard Burke,3,13,6,5,"Ew, this feels very weird."
Richard Burke,3,13,6,7,"Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them. That's my hand."
Richard Burke,3,13,6,9,Okay.
Richard Burke,3,13,6,11,Tomatoes are squishing.
Richard Burke,3,13,6,14,Op.
Richard Burke,3,13,6,16,Yeah.
Richard Burke,3,13,6,19,What?
Richard Burke,3,13,6,21,I'll just throw them out.
Richard Burke,3,13,8,5,You really sure?
Richard Burke,3,13,9,3,"Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball."
Richard Burke,3,13,9,5,Just your dad. Although that's actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister's neighbour next Tuesday.
Richard Burke,3,13,9,7,You want me to cancel it?
Richard Burke,3,13,9,9,Okay.
Richard Burke,3,13,9,11,Exactly.
Richard Burke,3,13,11,10,Hello.
Richard Burke,3,13,13,3,"Really?! Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment. It's got rooms, walls, and ceilings."
Richard Burke,3,13,13,6,"Ah well, this is the living room."
Richard Burke,3,13,13,8,All right. This is the kitchen.
Richard Burke,3,13,13,10,The bedroom. Well it's pretty much your typical... bedroom.
Richard Burke,3,13,13,12,Um-hmm.
Richard Burke,3,13,13,14,Oh shoot! Maybe next time. Thanks for a lovely evening.
Richard Burke,3,13,13,17,"Oh, that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today."
Richard Burke,3,13,13,19,"Well, you seem fine."
Richard Burke,3,13,13,21,You mean like exclusive friends?
Richard Burke,3,13,13,23,"Wow. Y'know we're back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed."
Richard Burke,3,13,13,25,"Okay, okay, one thing's changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end."
Richard Burke,3,13,13,27,I know I couldn't. So....
Richard Burke,3,13,13,32,Ow!!
Carol Willick,3,17,7,2,Hi!
Carol Willick,3,17,7,4,"Hey, what are you doing here?"
Carol Willick,3,17,7,6,"Ah yeah, but now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home."
Carol Willick,3,17,7,8,He's sleeping.
Carol Willick,3,17,7,10,"Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary."
Carol Willick,3,17,7,12,It's not that kind of anniversary.
Carol Willick,3,17,7,14,Sooo!! Anyway...
Carol Willick,3,17,7,16,"Oh God, Ross I am so sorry."
Carol Willick,3,17,7,18,"Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?"
Carol Willick,3,17,7,20,"Oh, great! Me too."
Carol Willick,3,17,9,3,"Ah, Susan will be so pleased."
Carol Willick,3,17,9,6,"No. But it's okay, I'll just put out pickles or something."
Carol Willick,3,17,9,17,"Phoebe, hang on a second. Here, take my car, go pick up your friends."
Carol Willick,3,17,9,19,"Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car."
Carol Willick,3,17,9,21,"Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you 'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you."
Carol Willick,3,17,9,23,Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. What? You slept with someone else?!
Carol Willick,3,17,9,25,You slept with another woman?
Carol Willick,3,17,11,2,Ugh. Ross!
Carol Willick,3,17,11,4,"Ahh, nooo!!"
Carol Willick,3,17,11,6,"You're a genius, Ross."
Carol Willick,3,17,11,8,"Okay, I'll pay you tomorrow."
Carol Willick,3,17,11,10,"Okay, bye!!"
Carol Willick,3,17,11,12,"Yeah, okay, bye."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,2,5,Hi!
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,2,7,Hi!
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,2,9,How are you?
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,2,11,"Oh, well y'know, I would've called but I lost your phone number and then ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldn't find it. And then, I tried to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. So..."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,2,13,"Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,2,15,"Well, we got into a fight 'cause ah, she said I was to immature to get married."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,2,17,"Oh, yeah!"
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,2,20,"Oh, I knew you'd be so cool about this. All right, ah, hey, do you want to meet her?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,2,22,Do you?
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,2,24,"Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my ah, my fiance man!"
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,2,32,"Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiance, Mrs. Knight."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,2,37,"Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight's ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,2,39,"Yeah, she was my best teacher."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,2,47,"I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn't want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, 'cause y'know, it'll be me. Right?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,7,4,"What, you don't think I know that?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,7,7,"Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,7,10,You don't have it anymore?
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,7,12,"Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,7,14,"Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,7,16,"It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,7,21,You can have it!
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,7,24,It's out there man! I've seen it! I got it!!
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,7,26,"All right, man!!"
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,11,2,"Hi. Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It's-it's me!"
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,11,4,"Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I'd curl up in it. Is that all right?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,11,6,"Oh, well just probably the worst one since I've been alive."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,11,8,"Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,11,10,"Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don't see how I could all of the sudden be too young, 'cause I'm older than I was when we first got together."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,11,12,"Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!"
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,11,14,"Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it's, and now it's gone and I don't know why!"
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,11,16,What?
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,11,18,"Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,11,20,"Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn't want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,11,22,"Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you'd understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go..."
Frank Buffay Jr.,3,18,15,4,"Hi, Mrs. Knight."
Judy Geller,4,3,4,2,How's the hired help?
Judy Geller,4,3,4,4,What's this? Blue nail polish?
Judy Geller,4,3,4,6,"Ahh, that's what your Grandmother's hands looked like when we found her."
Judy Geller,4,3,4,8,Hmm.
Judy Geller,4,3,4,10,"Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren't sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something."
Judy Geller,4,3,6,9,"Honey, don't bite your nails."
Judy Geller,4,3,6,12,I'm not freaking out.
Judy Geller,4,3,6,14,"It's nothing, it's just that now your Father owes me five dollars."
Judy Geller,4,3,6,16,"Oh no, don't be silly. I just bet I'd need these."
Judy Geller,4,3,6,18,Um-hmm.
Judy Geller,4,3,6,20,"No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica."
Judy Geller,4,3,6,22,"Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you've never been able to laugh at yourself."
Judy Geller,4,3,6,25,"No, I have faith..."
Judy Geller,4,3,14,8,"Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish."
Judy Geller,4,3,14,10,I thought it was... quite tasty.
Judy Geller,4,3,14,12,A bitch?
Judy Geller,4,3,14,14,"Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today."
Judy Geller,4,3,14,17,"And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer."
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,11,1,3,Oh I know!!
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,11,1,5,"'Cause it just sorta happened, y'know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch..."
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,11,1,7,"We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like, ""Hey! Y'know, we're here, having lunch let's get married!"
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,11,1,9,"Uhh, yeah."
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,11,1,11,"See the thing is umm, we're not able to y'know, uh, conceive."
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,11,1,13,"Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into."
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,11,10,8,Hi!
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,11,10,10,"Yeah, so we just thought we'd stop by and let you know there's still no pressure."
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,11,10,13,"Oh, who's this little guy?!"
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,11,10,15,"Oh, he's so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumour."
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,11,10,18,Are you serious?
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,11,10,20,"Oh, thanks."
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,11,10,24,"Oh my God, I think I'm gonna cry!"
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,12,3,4,"Well, okay, so what's now-go get, go get the eggs, put 'em in there."
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,12,3,11,"Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,12,3,14,"Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right."
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,12,3,19,I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,12,8,55,"Umm, it's a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test."
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,12,8,60,Okay.
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,12,8,75,MY SISTER'S GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!
Emily Waltham,4,14,3,45,Yes.
Emily Waltham,4,14,3,47,Thank goodness.
Emily Waltham,4,14,3,49,"Really?! Well, that's just lovely, isn't it? I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day."
Emily Waltham,4,14,3,51,"Oh, no-no-no, that's not rude! It's perfectly in keeping with a trip that I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum."
Emily Waltham,4,14,3,53,"Good night, it was very nice to meet you all."
Emily Waltham,4,14,5,8,Ross! Come quickly! There's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,2,17,"Oh well, I'm divorced."
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,2,19,"Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony."
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,2,21,"I just came up to say, ""Hi!"" Hi! And you, sweetie, I'll see you tonight."
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,2,23,Bye.
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,2,25,Bye.
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,2,27,Bye.
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,2,29,Bye-bye.
Emily Waltham,4,15,3,2,"I can't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York."
Emily Waltham,4,15,3,6,"No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. Liam, Devon, this is Ross."
Emily Waltham,4,15,3,10,"So how are you? I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, I've been rather busy."
Emily Waltham,4,15,3,12,Oh my God. I think you're right.
Emily Waltham,4,15,3,14,"Oh, Liam."
Emily Waltham,4,15,3,18,Ross play rugby? I don't think so.
Emily Waltham,4,15,3,20,"Well I mean, you're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here."
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,4,2,"Oh boy, I just love to sing!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,4,4,"Oh, look at us! Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails."
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,4,6,"I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,4,8,"Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time."
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,4,10,Oh no! Where to? Too Paris?
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,4,14,When?
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,4,16,"Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes."
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,6,5,Hey there Ross!
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,6,9,"Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn't really leave me much choice. Did you?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,6,17,"Chandler! Come on, I'm gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It's a real space saver."
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,6,19,"Okay, Chandler, come on!"
Emily Waltham,4,15,7,5,I'm just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
Emily Waltham,4,15,7,7,Okay.
Emily Waltham,4,15,7,19,"Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it's his first time."
Emily Waltham,4,15,7,21,"Good luck, babe."
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,9,3,"Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving."
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,9,5,"On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane."
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,9,14,What's the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
Emily Waltham,4,15,10,2,I can't believe they're doing that to him! I told them to go easy on him!
Emily Waltham,4,15,10,5,"That's just halftime, there's more of this."
Emily Waltham,4,15,10,8,Right.
Emily Waltham,4,15,10,10,Okay.
Emily Waltham,4,15,10,14,"Ross, they are killing you out there!"
Emily Waltham,4,15,10,20,"All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you."
Emily Waltham,4,15,10,22,No. That's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
Emily Waltham,4,15,10,24,"Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle."
Emily Waltham,4,15,10,26,One swift kick and he'll back off.
Emily Waltham,4,15,10,28,"And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup."
Emily Waltham,4,15,10,30,"And uh, Liam, Liam's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp."
Emily Waltham,4,15,10,32,I don't care! You just get him!
Emily Waltham,4,15,12,8,You were amazing out there.
Emily Waltham,4,15,12,10,Oh my God!
Emily Waltham,4,15,12,12,You really enjoyed yourself didn't you?
Emily Waltham,4,15,12,14,I think you've got concussion.
Emily Waltham,4,15,12,16,You're welcome. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,13,4,"Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,13,6,"Oh. Well, I'll right you everyday. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen."
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,13,9,Chandler?
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,13,11,Chandler!
Janice Litman Goralnik,4,15,13,13,No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
Emily Waltham,4,16,2,11,"My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting."
Emily Waltham,4,16,2,13,"They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that!"
Emily Waltham,4,16,2,15,"I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there. It's a joke."
Emily Waltham,4,16,2,17,"Right, I've got to be off, I'll see ya. Buh-bye then."
Emily Waltham,4,16,4,8,Hello?
Emily Waltham,4,16,4,11,No one's ever thrown me a surprise party before!
Emily Waltham,4,16,4,13,You're so sweet! And I'm so surprised!
Emily Waltham,4,16,4,31,"Oh, but the party's only just getting started!"
Emily Waltham,4,16,4,33,So why did you plan a party at the same time?
Emily Waltham,4,16,4,35,"But Ross, I'm such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties."
Emily Waltham,4,16,4,64,Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.
Emily Waltham,4,16,4,72,I'll go.
Emily Waltham,4,16,5,24,"But, we can't go now. It looks like Rachel's gonna put on a skit."
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,17,5,6,Yes.
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,17,5,9,I finally got my band!
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,17,5,12,Why would we be freaked?
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,17,5,14,Oh.
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,17,5,18,"Yeah, I've been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job."
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,17,5,21,"Yeah, refrigerator college."
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,17,5,23,"Yeah, y'know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y'know I figured y'know like I should y'know have like a career-and I love refrigerators!"
Frank Buffay Jr.,4,17,5,25,"No, it's okay. We're-we're gonna have three kids! And that's-that's a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money."
Emily Waltham,4,17,6,4,Oh my God! What are you doing here?
Emily Waltham,4,17,6,6,You are so sweet.
Emily Waltham,4,17,6,8,Me too.
Emily Waltham,4,17,6,10,"Well, that' me. Here, have this. I'm only allowed one piece of carryon anyway."
Emily Waltham,4,17,6,12,Oh. Thank you.
Emily Waltham,4,17,9,3,Ross.
Emily Waltham,4,17,9,5,It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
Emily Waltham,4,17,9,7,"Ross umm, there's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else."
Emily Waltham,4,17,12,4,"I've uh, I've come to talk to Ross."
Emily Waltham,4,17,12,6,What?
Emily Waltham,4,17,12,8,"I was going to call him, but..."
Emily Waltham,4,17,12,10,I'd really rather talk to him.
Emily Waltham,4,17,12,12,"I uh, I've been to his apartment and he wasn't there, and uh. I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?"
Emily Waltham,4,17,12,14,"Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this but... I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you."
Emily Waltham,4,17,12,16,"I wish I could know if you'd heard any of that. I suppose I've either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you're listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there's not much chance you did heard that, and there's the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well. Hello."
Emily Waltham,4,17,12,18,"Ross, I love you!"
Emily Waltham,4,18,2,2,"I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised?"
Emily Waltham,4,18,2,4,"Ohh, it's time to go."
Emily Waltham,4,18,2,6,Well that's ambitious.
Emily Waltham,4,18,2,9,That's Carol with your son!
Carol Willick,4,18,2,11,Ross!
Emily Waltham,4,18,2,14,Me too!
Carol Willick,4,18,2,15,"Ohh, y'know, Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week."
Emily Waltham,4,18,2,17,"Oh, well, I'll show you around."
Emily Waltham,4,18,2,19,"Oh, there's tonnes of terrific stuff-I'll go with you!"
Emily Waltham,4,18,2,23,Are you all right?
Carol Willick,4,18,7,3,Hey! How's Ben?
Carol Willick,4,18,7,5,"Hey, Ben! Hey!"
Carol Willick,4,18,7,7,"Ooh, yeah! She said she's having sooo much fun with Emily."
Carol Willick,4,18,7,9,What's too much fun?
Carol Willick,4,18,7,11,"Oh my God, you are so paranoid!"
Carol Willick,4,18,7,13,Yes!
Carol Willick,4,18,7,15,"I can't speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship."
Carol Willick,4,18,7,17,Maybe.
Carol Willick,4,18,13,3,I was gonna say...
Emily Waltham,4,18,13,8,Hey! I missed you.
Emily Waltham,4,18,13,11,"Oh, so did I."
Emily Waltham,4,19,2,2,"Oh, blimey, I still can't believe you've got an earring!"
Emily Waltham,4,19,2,5,He does that?!
Emily Waltham,4,19,2,7,I think it makes you look really dangerous.
Emily Waltham,4,19,2,9,I love both of you!
Emily Waltham,4,19,2,12,I wish I didn't have to go.
Emily Waltham,4,19,2,14,"Ohh, Ross, please!"
Emily Waltham,4,19,2,16,"Don't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me."
Emily Waltham,4,19,2,18,I wish I could.
Emily Waltham,4,19,2,20,"I don't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here."
Emily Waltham,4,19,2,22,You didn't!
Emily Waltham,4,19,6,3,I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.
Emily Waltham,4,19,6,5,What?!
Emily Waltham,4,19,6,7,"Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there."
Emily Waltham,4,19,6,9,My job!
Emily Waltham,4,19,6,11,"Yeah, but it-it-it's my whole life-you come to England."
Emily Waltham,4,19,6,13,"Ohh, I don't think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future &#150;and-and-and we were getting married or something."
Emily Waltham,4,19,6,15,"Oh no, no, right I shouldn't have said married. Uh, please don't go freaky on me. I didn't mean it. Well, I didn't say it; I take it back!"
Emily Waltham,4,19,6,17,Why don't we what?
Emily Waltham,4,19,6,19,You are mad!
Emily Waltham,4,19,6,21,We've only known each other for six weeks!
Emily Waltham,4,19,6,23,My parents are going to be really mad.
Emily Waltham,4,19,6,25,Yes.
Emily Waltham,4,19,6,27,Yes!
Emily Waltham,4,19,6,29,Oh my God!
Emily Waltham,4,19,6,31,We're getting married!
Emily Waltham,4,19,6,33,Yes.
Emily Waltham,4,19,6,35,"Ohh, it's a bit small."
Emily Waltham,4,19,6,37,It was.
Emily Waltham,4,19,7,52,"Umm, no."
Emily Waltham,4,19,7,55,"I mean, we know it's a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so..."
Emily Waltham,4,21,2,2,So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
Emily Waltham,4,21,2,4,"Yeah, they're fine."
Emily Waltham,4,21,2,6,"If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them. Oh! So you invited Rachel then?"
Emily Waltham,4,21,2,8,Really?
Emily Waltham,4,21,2,10,I don't think I'd be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
Emily Waltham,4,21,2,12,"Oh, no-no, y'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it's absolutely your decision. More tea?"
Emily Waltham,4,21,2,14,Earl Grey?
Judy Geller,4,21,28,2,Rachel's coming up the path. Doesn't she look pretty. Jack...
Judy Geller,4,21,28,8,Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.
Jack Geller,4,21,28,9,"Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is."
Jack Geller,4,21,28,14,It is off. Right Ross?
Judy Geller,4,21,28,19,I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.
Jack Geller,4,21,28,24,"C'mon kid, let's go."
Judy Geller,4,21,28,25,"Ahh, are you hadsome."
Jack Geller,4,21,28,26,Let's show 'em.
Jack Geller,4,21,28,28,"Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining-Oh no."
Judy Geller,4,21,28,30,"Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?"
Emily Waltham,4,23,4,2,"...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be..."
Emily Waltham,4,23,4,4,"Well, up yours too!"
Emily Waltham,4,23,4,6,"Oh, that's not what it means?"
Emily Waltham,4,23,4,8,Sorry.
Emily Waltham,4,23,4,14,I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... Oh my God!
Emily Waltham,4,23,4,16,Oh. Oh.
Emily Waltham,4,23,4,18,Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?
Emily Waltham,4,23,4,20,How's it gonna be all right?!
Emily Waltham,4,23,7,6,We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!
Emily Waltham,4,23,7,8,"I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!"
Emily Waltham,4,23,10,2,Hello?
Emily Waltham,4,23,10,4,We don't have to.
Emily Waltham,4,23,10,6,"No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit."
Emily Waltham,4,23,10,8,"She said, ""If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."""
Emily Waltham,4,23,10,10,"I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right."
Emily Waltham,4,23,10,12,"Don't you point your pants at me! We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about."
Emily Waltham,4,23,10,14,So what are you saying? It's now or never?
Emily Waltham,4,23,10,16,Or?
Emily Waltham,4,23,10,18,"It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!"
Emily Waltham,4,23,14,2,"Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!"
Emily Waltham,4,23,14,4,"I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen."
Emily Waltham,4,23,14,6,Oh God.
Emily Waltham,4,23,14,10,It's perfect.
Emily Waltham,4,23,14,12,Well then we'll get wet.
Judy Geller,4,24,2,4,"Sweetheart. Oh sorry were late, my fault, I insisted on riding the tube."
Jack Geller,4,24,2,5,"Judy, the kids.."
Judy Geller,4,24,2,6,"Jack, that's what they call the subway."
Jack Geller,4,24,2,7,"Ohh, I thought that you...."
Emily Waltham,4,24,2,9,"Ohh, here comes my dad and stepmum. Mister and Misses Geller, this is Steven and Andrea Waltham."
Jack Geller,4,24,2,17,"Ohh forget it. Too hell with tradition, we're happy to do it."
Judy Geller,4,24,2,18,"We know how expensive weddings can be, besides this may be the only wedding we get to throw ."
Jack Geller,4,24,3,9,What the hell!!!
Jack Geller,4,24,3,11,This bill for my half of the wedding. it's insane.
Judy Geller,4,24,3,12,How could it be so much? The receptions at their house.
Jack Geller,4,24,3,13,"Flowers, liquor, recarpet first floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I'm paying to remodel this guys house. I'm going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind."
Jack Geller,4,24,3,15,And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.
Judy Geller,4,24,3,16,"Ooh, Jack.... Sometimes I forget how powerful you can be."
Jack Geller,4,24,8,11,"There's no way in hell, I'm paying for it."
Jack Geller,4,24,8,13,"All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man."
Judy Geller,4,24,16,2,Oh my God! It's like a fairyland.
Judy Geller,4,24,16,5,I just hope...
Judy Geller,4,24,17,11,There's nothing to discuss. We're not paying for your wine cellar.
Jack Geller,4,24,17,13,"Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet the middle of your ass."
Emily Waltham,4,24,17,15,What-what's going on?!
Jack Geller,4,24,17,19,"Okay, okay."
Emily Waltham,4,24,17,21,What was all that about?
Emily Waltham,4,24,17,23,Ohh... Oh! You were not meant to see me before the wedding. It's bad luck.
Emily Waltham,4,24,18,24,"I, Emily..."
Emily Waltham,4,24,18,26,Take thee Ross...
Emily Waltham,4,24,18,28,"As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, until death parts us."
Emily Waltham,4,24,18,37,"Yes, yes, do go on."
Jack Geller,4,24,18,39,He better go on for what I'm paying.
Judy Geller,4,24,18,55,This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
Emily Waltham,4,24,18,57,Just keep smiling.
Emily Waltham,4,24,19,2,You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
Emily Waltham,4,24,19,5,I hate you!!
Jack Geller,4,24,19,7,"Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?"
Judy Geller,4,24,19,47,"Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?"
Jack Geller,4,24,19,49,"Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?"
Emily Waltham,5,1,1,8,"Yes, yes, do go on."
Judy Geller,5,1,1,21,This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
Emily Waltham,5,1,1,23,Just keep smiling.
Emily Waltham,5,1,2,2,You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
Emily Waltham,5,1,2,5,I hate you!!
Jack Geller,5,1,2,7,"Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?"
Judy Geller,5,1,2,47,"Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?"
Jack Geller,5,1,2,49,"Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,5,3,2,27,Hey!
Frank Buffay Jr.,5,3,2,29,"Hey! Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,5,3,2,31,"Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff."
Frank Buffay Jr.,5,3,2,33,Yeah.

Frank Buffay Jr.,5,3,13,46,"No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes."
Frank Buffay Jr.,5,3,13,48,Yeah.
Emily Waltham,5,4,2,33,"Hello, Ross?"
Emily Waltham,5,4,2,35,"Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!"
Emily Waltham,5,4,2,37,Really? About what?
Emily Waltham,5,4,2,39,"I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do."
Emily Waltham,5,4,6,3,I understand that would be difficult.
Emily Waltham,5,4,6,5,"I don't know, it's just..."
Emily Waltham,5,4,6,7,All right.
Emily Waltham,5,4,6,9,I did. Now I'm the idiot.
Emily Waltham,5,4,6,12,"Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still."
Emily Waltham,5,4,6,14,"Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends."
Emily Waltham,5,4,6,16,"And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her."
Emily Waltham,5,4,6,18,"I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!"
Emily Waltham,5,4,6,20,All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.
Emily Waltham,5,4,6,22,As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
Emily Waltham,5,6,11,35,Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?
Emily Waltham,5,6,11,37,"Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now."
Emily Waltham,5,6,11,40,She's there?!
Emily Waltham,5,6,11,43,"Ross, take me off speakerphone."
Emily Waltham,5,6,11,46,How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!
Emily Waltham,5,6,11,48,You obviously can't keep away from her.
Emily Waltham,5,6,11,50,"I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time."
Emily Waltham,5,6,11,52,You're right.
Emily Waltham,5,6,11,55,No.
Judy Geller,5,8,9,2,Monica! I think Rachel's here!
Jack Geller,5,8,9,9,Hi Rachel!
Judy Geller,5,8,9,11,You too sweethart!
Jack Geller,5,8,9,14,Oh my!
Judy Geller,5,8,9,20,"I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry."
Judy Geller,5,8,9,22,"Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then."
Judy Geller,5,8,9,63,"Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge."
Jack Geller,5,8,9,65,"Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!"
Judy Geller,5,8,11,2,"So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again."
Jack Geller,5,8,11,4,Hi Rachel.
Jack Geller,5,8,11,6,"Wow, love your new nose!"
Judy Geller,5,8,11,7,Jack.
Jack Geller,5,8,11,8,What? Dr. Wilson's an artist! He removed my mole cluster. Wanna see?
Judy Geller,5,8,11,9,I'll get it.
Jack Geller,5,8,11,14,"God, your hair sure is different!"
Judy Geller,5,8,11,17,"She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel, and the boy who hates Thanksgiving."
Judy Geller,5,8,11,25,"Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend."
Jack Geller,5,8,11,29,Dude!
Jack Geller,5,8,12,7,Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
Judy Geller,5,8,12,16,Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
Jack Geller,5,8,12,21,"Oh, I'm not falling for that one!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,5,12,8,19,Ross you left you scarf in... Hey you guys.
Janice Litman Goralnik,5,12,9,2,Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!
Janice Litman Goralnik,5,12,9,4,"So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me."
Janice Litman Goralnik,5,12,9,6,"Oh! Okay! You, Mister Right Place at the Right Time, call me!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,5,12,14,4,"Actually, I should get going."
Janice Litman Goralnik,5,12,14,6,Yes! Yes! You did!
Janice Litman Goralnik,5,12,14,8,What is wrong now?!
Janice Litman Goralnik,5,12,14,10,"I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee-ahh!! Ross, we need to talk."
Janice Litman Goralnik,5,12,14,12,"No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun."
Janice Litman Goralnik,5,12,14,14,"You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,5,12,14,16,Well yeah!!
Janice Litman Goralnik,5,12,14,18,Are you gonna be okay?
Janice Litman Goralnik,5,12,14,20,Okay.
Janice Litman Goralnik,5,12,14,23,"Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey."
Carol Willick,5,18,1,9,Hey guys!
Carol Willick,5,18,1,13,Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!
Carol Willick,5,18,3,5,"Hey, that kid looks familiar."
Carol Willick,5,18,3,11,"Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that."
Carol Willick,5,18,7,4,Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
Carol Willick,5,18,11,3,"Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?"
Carol Willick,5,18,11,5,Thanks.
Emily Waltham,5,20,4,11,"Hello Ross? It's Emily. I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye."
Emily Waltham,5,20,6,2,"Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye."
Judy Geller,6,9,3,39,Hello everybody!
Jack Geller,6,9,3,40,Hi!
Judy Geller,6,9,3,44,"Oh yes of course, hello Chandler."
Jack Geller,6,9,3,48,No.
Jack Geller,6,9,3,50,"Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living."
Jack Geller,6,9,3,52,"Ok, I have dandruff. There's no need to laugh and point."
Jack Geller,6,9,3,55,My joke wasn't funny.
Jack Geller,6,9,3,65,"I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?"
Judy Geller,6,9,3,105,"Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it."
Jack Geller,6,9,3,107,What's the matter with him?
Judy Geller,6,9,3,108,I think he's stoned again.
Judy Geller,6,9,7,56,"I've gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica's room."
Jack Geller,6,9,7,57,I'll help you dial.
Jack Geller,6,9,7,80,"Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today."
Judy Geller,6,9,7,92,It was you?
Judy Geller,6,9,7,108,"That's alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I'm sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me."
Jack Geller,6,9,7,109,And we kinda figured about the porch swing.
Judy Geller,6,9,7,110,"Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?"
Jack Geller,6,9,7,111,What happened son?
Judy Geller,6,9,7,113,"Chandler! You've been Ross's best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems. And now you've taken on Monica as well. Well, I don't know what to say. You're a wonderful human being."
Jack Geller,6,9,7,116,"No! Thank you! Monica, and Ross! I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you!"
Judy Geller,6,9,8,5,Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
Carol Willick,6,15,8,3,Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
Carol Willick,6,15,8,5,What do you mean?
Carol Willick,6,15,8,11,Like what?
Carol Willick,6,15,8,13,I love that idea!
Carol Willick,6,16,1,3,"Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!"
Carol Willick,6,16,1,5,"Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so..."
Carol Willick,6,16,1,7,"Oh, me too."
Carol Willick,6,16,1,9,"Oh umm, y'know I think it would be better if we just save it."
Carol Willick,6,16,5,3,Looks like it.
Carol Willick,6,16,5,5,I got it!
Carol Willick,6,16,5,7,Susan! Hi!
Carol Willick,6,16,5,9,Thank you so much for coming.
Carol Willick,6,16,5,14,Thank you so much.
Janice Litman Goralnik,6,17,12,12,I love the way you look every night Chandler! That's why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice!
Janice Litman Goralnik,6,20,8,47,Oh.... my.... God.
Richard Burke,6,24,7,19,Monica! Chandler!
Richard Burke,6,24,7,22,"You too, you let uh, your hair grow long."
Richard Burke,6,24,7,24,"Well, my nose got lonely."
Richard Burke,6,24,7,28,"Oh, I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date."
Richard Burke,6,24,7,34,Oh. Good to see you guys.
Richard Burke,6,24,7,37,That might be fun.
Richard Burke,6,24,9,3,And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
Richard Burke,6,24,9,9,"It's so great seeing you guys again. I'd like to make a toast. Uh, as a poet once said, ""In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it's morning and is refreshed."""
Richard Burke,6,24,15,6,Hi!
Richard Burke,6,24,15,8,"Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef."
Richard Burke,6,24,15,10,"Well, it was great seeing you the other night."
Richard Burke,6,24,15,12,No! I came here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.
Richard Burke,6,25,1,3,"I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, I mean you're with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he's straight I'll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn't tell ya I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did."
Richard Burke,6,25,1,5,"Well yeah, I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you."
Richard Burke,6,25,1,7,I know this is crazy but am I too late?
Richard Burke,6,25,1,9,"Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y'know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!"
Richard Burke,6,25,1,11,Working with blind kids.
Richard Burke,6,25,1,13,"Okay that's fine, I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am."
Richard Burke,6,25,1,15,You are?
Richard Burke,6,25,1,17,Why?
Richard Burke,6,25,8,3,Hi.
Richard Burke,6,25,8,5,I didn't ask. You wanna come in?
Richard Burke,6,25,8,7,"Oh, okay. Well, I'll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch."
Richard Burke,6,25,8,9,Drink?
Richard Burke,6,25,8,11,...on the rocks with a twist? I remember.
Richard Burke,6,25,8,13,"Uh, no! No! That's...art! If it bothers you I can put my art out."
Richard Burke,6,25,8,15,"So Monica let me ask you a question. Y'know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?"
Richard Burke,6,25,8,17,Oh really?
Richard Burke,6,25,8,19,Who is it?
Richard Burke,6,25,8,21,Yeah he's no good. Do you ever think about me in a non-eye doctor way?
Richard Burke,6,25,8,23,Ahh.
Richard Burke,6,25,10,3,Excuse me?
Richard Burke,6,25,10,5,Oh. Whew!
Richard Burke,6,25,10,7,"Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache."
Richard Burke,6,25,10,9,I think that's fair.
Richard Burke,6,25,10,11,It's okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. Shhhh.
Richard Burke,6,25,10,13,I know.
Richard Burke,6,25,10,15,"Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want. Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. I'll be here. Not smoking."
Richard Burke,6,25,11,2,Chandler.
Richard Burke,6,25,11,4,She's not here and please come in.
Richard Burke,6,25,11,6,"Okay, she was here, but she left."
Richard Burke,6,25,11,8,Well she said she had to think things over.
Richard Burke,6,25,11,10,"Oh, hey look nothing happened."
Richard Burke,6,25,11,12,"Well all right, one thing happened?"
Richard Burke,6,25,11,14,Well I'm sorry.
Richard Burke,6,25,11,16,"Well, apparently I'm willing to offer her things that you are not."
Richard Burke,6,25,11,18,"Well if it helps, it worked very well."
Richard Burke,6,25,11,20,You were gonna propose?
Richard Burke,6,25,11,22,"No I don't have a ring! You go get her Chandler. And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don't let her go. Trust me."
Richard Burke,6,25,11,24,I know. I hate that!
Judy Geller,7,2,7,2,"So Chandler, you're parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged."
Jack Geller,7,2,7,4,I remember when we first got engaged.
Jack Geller,7,2,7,7,"Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know that happened."
Judy Geller,7,2,7,8,You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
Jack Geller,7,2,7,11,What?! They wanted a scary story!
Judy Geller,7,2,7,13,"You tell her Jack, I can't do it."
Jack Geller,7,2,7,15,"We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house."
Judy Geller,7,2,8,3,"We're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself."
Jack Geller,7,2,8,5,Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't put a price on that sweetie.
Judy Geller,7,2,8,6,We really do feel bad about this though.
Jack Geller,7,2,8,7,"We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen."
Judy Geller,7,2,8,9,Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose!
Judy Geller,7,2,8,12,"We might still have some money, if your father didn't think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet."
Jack Geller,7,2,8,13,It seemed like such a simple idea.
Judy Geller,7,2,8,14,"Stupid Jack, the word is stupid."
Jack Geller,7,2,8,15,"All right, enough! I don't want to hear about it anymore! Good luck, Chandler."
Jack Geller,7,3,5,21,Have a seat son. Hey!!
Jack Geller,7,3,11,3,"I understand completely, there's nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer."
Jack Geller,7,3,11,5,"They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?"
Tag Jones,7,4,3,18,That's it. That's my whole name.
Tag Jones,7,4,3,20,"I know I haven't worked in an office before, and I really don't have a lot of experience, but uh..."
Tag Jones,7,4,3,22,"It's lame, I know. But I'm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn..."
Tag Jones,7,4,7,3,I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren't any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first... There is a plant in your office.
Tag Jones,7,4,7,5,Right. So I guess I shouldn't put good at noticing stuff on my resume.
Tag Jones,7,4,7,7,"Anyway, I'm guessing you hired somebody."
Tag Jones,7,4,7,9,Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me.
Tag Jones,7,4,7,11,What?
Tag Jones,7,4,7,13,I am?!
Tag Jones,7,4,7,15,I can't believe it!
Tag Jones,7,4,12,2,Rachel Green's office.
Tag Jones,7,4,12,4,Nobody. I was just practicing.
Tag Jones,7,4,12,8,Hi! Rachel Green's office.
Tag Jones,7,4,12,11,Phoebe! That's a great name.
Tag Jones,7,4,15,3,Do you have a minute?
Tag Jones,7,4,15,5,I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch...by guys.
Tag Jones,7,4,15,7,Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Tag Jones,7,4,15,9,But I'm not gay. And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.
Tag Jones,7,4,15,11,I don't think I should say.
Tag Jones,7,4,15,13,Okay.
Tag Jones,7,4,15,15,Well...
Tag Jones,7,4,15,17,I'd love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
Tag Jones,7,5,3,3,I just did them.
Tag Jones,7,5,3,5,What?
Tag Jones,7,5,3,7,"Yeah, I filled them out last night?"
Tag Jones,7,5,9,2,Good morning.
Tag Jones,7,5,9,4,Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
Tag Jones,7,5,9,6,Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
Tag Jones,7,5,9,8,"Well kinda old, like 30."
Tag Jones,7,5,9,10,"And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night."
Tag Jones,7,5,9,12,A little.
Tag Jones,7,5,9,15,How you doin'?
Tag Jones,7,5,11,2,"Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?"
Tag Jones,7,5,11,4,"Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel."
Tag Jones,7,5,11,7,Really?
Tag Jones,7,5,14,2,Good morning Rachel.
Tag Jones,7,5,14,4,Went out with Joey.
Tag Jones,7,5,14,6,No. We had a really good talk. I don't think I'm gonna do that bar scene anymore.
Tag Jones,7,5,14,8,"It's just not really who I am. Y'know, I've always been happier when...Why am I telling you this? You don't care about this stuff."
Tag Jones,7,5,14,10,"When I'm in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend."
Tag Jones,7,5,14,12,"Someone I can spoil, y'know?"
Tag Jones,7,5,14,14,Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?
Tag Jones,7,5,14,16,Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?
Tag Jones,7,5,14,18,"And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right?"
Tag Jones,7,5,14,20,"All right then, it's settled."
Tag Jones,7,5,14,22,I'm gettin' back together with my ex-girlfriend.
Tag Jones,7,5,14,24,What?
Janice Litman Goralnik,7,7,3,8,How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever!
Janice Litman Goralnik,7,7,3,10,Ohh! What is that on your finger?! I'm blind!
Janice Litman Goralnik,7,7,3,12,"So, who's the lucky guy?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,7,7,8,2,Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
Janice Litman Goralnik,7,7,8,4,"Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours."
Janice Litman Goralnik,7,7,8,6,"I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don't you tell about your lovely wedding?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,7,7,8,9,"Oh...wait...you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,7,7,12,5,Chandler?
Janice Litman Goralnik,7,7,12,8,"Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn't really be alone tonight. I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family."
Janice Litman Goralnik,7,7,12,10,"Please, it's because otherwise I really don't know what I might do."
Janice Litman Goralnik,7,7,12,12,Do you have any tissues?
Janice Litman Goralnik,7,7,12,14,Okay!
Janice Litman Goralnik,7,7,12,20,"Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath."
Janice Litman Goralnik,7,7,12,22,Why not?
Janice Litman Goralnik,7,7,12,25,"Okay, I'm going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. Do you have a cat? 'Cause it's already happening. Do you hear that?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,7,7,12,28,Why?
Janice Litman Goralnik,7,7,12,30,He does?
Janice Litman Goralnik,7,7,12,35,"Oh...my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I'll go. Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, you call me when this goes in the pooper."
Tag Jones,7,8,4,13,"I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good."
Tag Jones,7,8,4,15,We kinda broke up this morning.
Tag Jones,7,8,4,17,"Yeah, so she went back to Ohio."
Tag Jones,7,8,4,50,You don't like puppies?
Tag Jones,7,8,4,80,Hey.
Tag Jones,7,8,4,82,Not bad.
Tag Jones,7,8,4,84,Thanks.
Tag Jones,7,8,4,86,A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
Tag Jones,7,8,4,88,Yeah.
Tag Jones,7,8,4,90,"It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?"
Tag Jones,7,8,4,92,Why?
Tag Jones,7,8,4,94,"You have all the answers, don't you?"
Tag Jones,7,8,4,96,"Hey, thanks for talking to me."
Tag Jones,7,8,4,99,What?
Tag Jones,7,8,5,2,What did Joey say? I like you back?
Tag Jones,7,8,5,4,Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.
Tag Jones,7,8,5,6,Wow.
Tag Jones,7,8,5,8,Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car!
Tag Jones,7,8,5,10,Right there! That's my car! Hey!!
Tag Jones,7,8,5,12,I can't believe this!
Tag Jones,7,8,7,66,I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
Tag Jones,7,8,7,68,"Thanks for having me over, you guys."
Tag Jones,7,8,7,70,Colorado.
Tag Jones,7,8,7,74,Okay.
Tag Jones,7,8,7,76,"Um, I'm not."
Tag Jones,7,8,7,78,"No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us."
Tag Jones,7,8,7,80,"Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this."
Tag Jones,7,9,3,3,"Yes, at 4:00."
Tag Jones,7,9,3,5,I'd better get back to my desk.
Tag Jones,7,9,3,7,My what?
Tag Jones,7,9,3,9,Are you serious?
Tag Jones,7,9,6,3,No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.
Tag Jones,7,9,6,5,A joke they would appreciate?
Tag Jones,7,9,6,7,What did you say?!
Tag Jones,7,9,6,9,"No, not my touchie."
Tag Jones,7,9,11,3,That's kinda sad.
Tag Jones,7,9,11,5,Got it!
Tag Jones,7,9,11,16,"Uh Mr. Zelner, I'm the one who filled in that evaluation."
Tag Jones,7,9,11,18,"Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny."
Tag Jones,7,9,11,20,"Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and I'm kinda strangely proud of my butt."
Tag Jones,7,9,11,25,"No, don't worry about it."
Tag Jones,7,9,11,27,"Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I'd find work."
Tag Jones,7,9,11,29,Y'know what?
Tag Jones,7,9,11,31,I feel great. In fact! What?
Tag Jones,7,9,11,33,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Tag Jones,7,12,1,10,"Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here."
Tag Jones,7,12,1,12,What?
Tag Jones,7,12,7,3,Sure.
Tag Jones,7,12,7,5,If this is your idea of sexy talk?
Tag Jones,7,12,7,7,What contracts?
Tag Jones,7,12,7,9,Like what?
Tag Jones,7,12,7,11,"Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!"
Tag Jones,7,12,7,13,"I'm telling you, you never gave them to me."
Tag Jones,7,12,7,15,"No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!"
Tag Jones,7,12,7,17,You wanna go down to the office right now?
Tag Jones,7,12,7,19,Okay I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
Tag Jones,7,12,11,2,"Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk."
Tag Jones,7,12,11,4,It's my sister.
Tag Jones,7,12,11,6,So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
Tag Jones,7,12,12,2,It's not here.
Tag Jones,7,12,12,4,How could I have left them in the copy room?
Tag Jones,7,12,12,6,Fine.
Tag Jones,7,12,17,3,Still no luck.
Tag Jones,7,12,17,5,Do you want me to check again?
Tag Jones,7,12,17,7,"Well, it's not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?"
Tag Jones,7,12,17,9,Any luck?
Tag Jones,7,12,17,11,Yeah? You found them!! Y'know what? I'm not even going to gloat. I'm just really relived this whole thing is over.
Tag Jones,7,12,17,13,I did not!
Tag Jones,7,12,17,15,How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
Jack Geller,7,13,7,3,I'm here!
Jack Geller,7,13,7,5,"Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work."
Jack Geller,7,13,7,7,"Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling."
Jack Geller,7,13,7,9,I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
Jack Geller,7,13,7,11,"Well, I don't know what's in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic."
Jack Geller,7,13,7,15,"So, I think you're boxes are over here."
Jack Geller,7,13,7,17,"I don't know. They-they must be your mother's, but please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away."
Jack Geller,7,13,7,19,"Oh look, look there's your old makeup kit!"
Jack Geller,7,13,7,21,"Well, the white seems to be untouched. Uh-oh."
Jack Geller,7,13,7,23,Y'know how the garage floods every Spring?
Jack Geller,7,13,7,25,I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
Jack Geller,7,13,7,27,You don't secretly smoke do you?
Jack Geller,7,13,7,29,So it's just your mother then.
Jack Geller,7,13,11,2,"Well, she'll understand right? It's not like I did it on purpose."
Jack Geller,7,13,11,4,"Oh my God, does she really thinks that?"
Jack Geller,7,13,11,6,"Well I don't know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could..."
Jack Geller,7,13,11,8,Really?
Jack Geller,7,13,11,10,Great!
Jack Geller,7,13,11,12,Sure!
Jack Geller,7,13,11,14,This could've been hers!
Jack Geller,7,13,11,16,Your make-up kit? I'd feel better.
Jack Geller,7,13,14,5,That's a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
Jack Geller,7,13,14,14,"Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove."
Jack Geller,7,13,14,21,"Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. I'm sorry."
Jack Geller,7,13,14,23,I'm afraid so.
Jack Geller,7,13,14,25,"Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche."
Jack Geller,7,13,14,27,There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
Jack Geller,7,13,14,29,Screw it! I'm having one.
Jack Geller,7,13,17,5,How are you honey?
Jack Geller,7,13,17,8,"Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I'm sorry about everything that happened and I'd probably never be able to make it up to you, but here's a start."
Jack Geller,7,13,17,10,"It's the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche."
Jack Geller,7,13,17,13,"I've been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother's right, I do look like an ass."
Jack Geller,7,13,17,16,Why don't we take it for a spin?
Tag Jones,7,14,1,7,Hey.
Tag Jones,7,14,1,9,Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you don't use the words old or downhill or they still look pretty damn good.
Tag Jones,7,14,3,3,"Come on, let's have some fun. Huh? What do you want to do today?"
Tag Jones,7,14,4,5,"Look Rachel, I know what you're going through. I'm totally freaked about turning 25."
Tag Jones,7,14,4,9,Why? What you'd do?
Judy Geller,7,14,4,16,You've done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.
Jack Geller,7,14,4,18,It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
Jack Geller,7,14,4,22,Crap.
Jack Geller,7,14,7,5,"Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug!"
Judy Geller,7,14,7,6,Don't get up Jack! The safety pins are about to blow.
Tag Jones,7,14,8,2,This one's from me.
Tag Jones,7,14,8,4,"It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun."
Judy Geller,7,14,10,14,Speech! Come on Monica!
Jack Geller,7,14,10,18,"Hey Chandler, you can't keep your hands off her for one second!"
Judy Geller,7,14,10,19,"Oh-ho, I think it's nice."
Tag Jones,7,14,13,11,Hey.
Tag Jones,7,14,13,13,How are you doing? Are you feeling any better?
Tag Jones,7,14,13,15,Okay.
Tag Jones,7,14,13,17,What's up?
Tag Jones,7,14,13,19,"Wait! I think I see where you're going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?"
Tag Jones,7,14,13,21,"Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you're turning thirty."
Tag Jones,7,14,13,23,Twenty-four actually.
Tag Jones,7,14,13,25,Me too.
Carol Willick,7,16,7,2,Hey Rachel!
Carol Willick,7,16,7,4,What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?
Carol Willick,7,16,7,6,Can I ask what-Come on in.
Carol Willick,7,16,7,8,"Umm uh, I'll make some coffee and we can uh, chat."
Carol Willick,7,16,7,12,"Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?"
Carol Willick,7,16,10,19,Hey Ross!
Carol Willick,7,16,10,21,What's not funny?
Carol Willick,7,16,10,23,Oh I...I think they're funny.
Carol Willick,7,16,10,25,What?
Carol Willick,7,16,10,27,Oh my God!
Richard Burke,7,23,3,6,Nice to meet you Joey.
Richard Burke,7,23,3,8,No I didn't.
Richard Burke,7,23,3,10,I think I lost. Three times.
Richard Burke,7,23,3,13,"Yeah, sure."
Richard Burke,7,23,3,16,Forget the platoon! The platoon is gone!
Richard Burke,7,23,3,18,The platoon is dead! Face facts Tony!
Richard Burke,7,23,3,20,"No, we still have food in the basement! I saw potatoes and some dry pasta!"
Richard Burke,7,23,3,25,"We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna!"
Judy Geller,7,23,5,18,It's lovely to meet you.
Jack Geller,7,23,5,19,So are you his mother or his father?
Judy Geller,7,23,5,20,Jack!
Jack Geller,7,23,5,21,What?! I've never seen one before!
Jack Geller,7,23,5,24,I didn't even have a chance to act as though I'm okay with it!
Jack Geller,7,23,5,35,...of course you can kick his ass son.
Judy Geller,7,23,5,36,You could kick anyone's ass you want too.
Jack Geller,7,23,5,46,Doctor Ross Geller.
Richard Burke,7,23,10,2,"Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me?"
Richard Burke,7,23,10,4,Just the last two pages.
Richard Burke,7,23,10,7,I found the picture!
Richard Burke,7,23,10,10,"Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction."
Richard Burke,7,23,10,12,"Oh, thanks."
Richard Burke,7,23,10,14,Well of course I am!
Richard Burke,7,23,10,16,"That's what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit!"
Richard Burke,7,23,10,18,Great!
Jack Geller,7,23,11,9,"Well you kids talk about this place so much, we thought we'd see what all the fuss is about."
Judy Geller,7,23,11,10,I certainly see what the girls like coming here.
Judy Geller,7,23,11,12,The sexy blonde behind the counter.
Jack Geller,7,23,11,14,Your mother just added him to her list.
Judy Geller,7,23,11,16,"Yeah, the list that-of people we're allowed to sleep..."
Jack Geller,7,23,11,18,"And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I'm looking for her."
Richard Burke,7,23,12,3,I found the picture!
Richard Burke,7,23,12,5,The picture of my wife! In your pack!
Richard Burke,7,23,12,7,Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
Richard Burke,7,23,12,12,"Oh you're awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me."
Richard Burke,7,24,3,15,I'm wearing two belts.
Richard Burke,7,24,3,17,No!
Richard Burke,7,24,3,19,All right.
Richard Burke,7,24,6,3,That can be arranged.
Richard Burke,7,24,6,8,Are you a little off today? It's going terribly slowly.
Richard Burke,7,24,6,10,Of course! I'm-I'm sorry. I-I'd hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!
Richard Burke,7,24,6,14,"Now, that can be arranged! Slippery little bugger!"
Judy Geller,7,24,7,4,Here comes the bride.
Jack Geller,7,24,10,3,I thought he was with you.
Jack Geller,7,24,10,5,"You can't ask us son, that's cheating."
Judy Geller,7,24,10,7,"Well, he better not come by here. He can't see the bride in the wedding dress."
Richard Burke,7,24,11,5,You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?
Richard Burke,7,24,11,7,Well have we finished the scene?
Richard Burke,7,24,11,9,As were you.
Richard Burke,7,24,11,11,Why? Are we done for the day?
Richard Burke,7,24,11,13,"Oh, thank you. You're welcome."
Richard Burke,7,24,11,15,Is that my ass?
Jack Geller,7,24,12,28,Way to go son! I knew you'd find him!
Judy Geller,7,24,13,13,Oh I wish you're grandmother had lived to see this.
Judy Geller,7,24,13,15,"Not that old crow, my mother. Congratulations darling."
Jack Geller,7,24,13,16,I love you sweetheart.
Jack Geller,8,1,4,105,"Chandler, I'm gonna have you arrested."
Jack Geller,8,1,4,107,You stole my moves.
Tag Jones,8,2,8,11,Hey Rach.
Tag Jones,8,2,10,2,"So, what's this about?"
Tag Jones,8,2,10,4,No. This is my red sweater.
Tag Jones,8,2,10,6,What's going on Rach?
Tag Jones,8,2,10,8,"Y'know, I'm actually glad Phoebe called. I know we broke up because you thought I wasn't mature enough, but I've really grown up and think we should get back together."
Tag Jones,8,2,10,10,It is the right time.
Tag Jones,8,2,10,12,I'm ready for more.
Tag Jones,8,2,10,14,"Come on Rach, let's give it another try."
Tag Jones,8,2,10,16,Oh.
Tag Jones,8,2,10,19,Thank you.
Tag Jones,8,2,12,3,"Good! Good, long time no see."
Tag Jones,8,2,12,5,Like your sweater.
Tag Jones,8,2,12,7,"Oh, it's crazy about Rachel huh?"
Tag Jones,8,2,12,9,So whose is it?
Tag Jones,8,2,12,11,Okay.
Judy Geller,8,18,3,5,Jack?
Jack Geller,8,18,3,6,Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick?
Judy Geller,8,18,3,13,"Can we talk to you for just a y'know... It's just a little thing. Well we think it's absolutely marvelous that you're having this baby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded. Which is why we've told them all that you're married."
Judy Geller,8,18,3,15,Thanks for going along with this.
Jack Geller,8,18,3,17,"Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight. You can do this."
Judy Geller,8,18,4,77,"Thank you Monica that was uh, interesting. Wasn't it interesting, Jack?"
Jack Geller,8,18,4,78,Why don't I remember this dog?
Judy Geller,8,18,4,79,"Ross, why don't you give us your toast now?"
Judy Geller,8,18,4,81,You're not going to say anything? On our 35th wedding anniversary?
Judy Geller,8,18,4,83,Oh Ross...
Jack Geller,8,18,4,84,I just wish Nana were alive to hear Ross's toast.
Judy Geller,8,23,4,9,Am I interrupting?
Judy Geller,8,23,5,3,"Oh that's all right, I'm coming back later with your father."
Judy Geller,8,23,5,5,I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.
Judy Geller,8,23,5,7,"I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it."
Judy Geller,8,23,5,9,"This is your grandmother's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel."
Judy Geller,8,23,5,11,Just hear me out!
Judy Geller,8,23,5,13,"Honestly! Ross, this isn't just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped. A child should have a family."
Judy Geller,8,23,5,15,"Just...think about it. If you don't, I'll talk more about humping."
Judy Geller,8,23,5,18,Oh hi dear!
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,4,2,I....can't....believe this!
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,4,4,I mean this is so great! We're gonna be baby buddies!
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,4,7,"Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I don't think you've met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist's office. Thank God for adult acne huh?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,4,11,"Oh y'know what? You have to speak very loudly when you're talking to Sid, because he's almost completely deaf."
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,4,15,"So? Congratulations you two, I didn't even know you got married."
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,4,18,What?!
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,4,20,Why?!!
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,4,22,Oh. Well then shut me up.
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,4,24,"Uh-oh, I feel another one coming."
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,7,9,Chandler Bing!
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,7,12,"Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler."
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,7,14,It's you. This is yours.
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,7,16,Look how nervous he gets! We haven't slept together in years!
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,14,2,Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,14,4,He's a keeper. How are you feeling?
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,14,6,"Can I just say, I really admire what you're doing. Just raising her all alone."
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,14,8,"Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,14,10,"I'm telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they're gonna be there until they start their real family."
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,14,12,"Oh well that's what I thought about my first husband, now I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs."
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,14,14,"I hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two are on your own."
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,14,17,Oh hi!
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,14,19,"Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law."
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,14,21,I'm gonna leave the three of you alone.
Janice Litman Goralnik,8,24,14,23,Bye.
Jack Geller,9,1,1,15,Where's my granddaughter? I've been practicing my magic tricks.
Jack Geller,9,1,1,18,She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.
Jack Geller,9,1,1,20,So when do I get to meet Emma and show her this?
Jack Geller,9,1,2,2,"Look at her, my first grandchild."
Jack Geller,9,1,2,4,"Well of course Ben, I meant my first granddaughter. Wow."
Jack Geller,9,1,2,41,Noted.
Jack Geller,9,1,2,43,"Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever."
Jack Geller,9,1,4,2,I think there are people in there having sex.
Jack Geller,9,1,4,4,Wanna peek?
Jack Geller,9,1,4,6,Come on!
Jack Geller,9,1,4,9,Well I'm peeking. Oh my God!
Jack Geller,9,1,7,5,Of course. I'll always be your dad.
Jack Geller,9,1,7,9,"Oh, I don't think that. Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all. It was a simpler time."
Jack Geller,9,1,7,11,What?
Jack Geller,9,1,7,13,"Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there! I'll guard the door!"
Jack Geller,9,1,7,15,Whoa-whoa-whoa! I don't think so! Aren't you ovulating?
Jack Geller,9,1,7,17,"Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. That's how I got my bad hip."
Jack Geller,9,1,7,19,"This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was."
Jack Geller,9,1,7,21,"You're right, you're right. This is about your positions. Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good."
Jack Geller,9,1,7,23,"But pleasure is important, and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?"
Jack Geller,9,1,11,1,"Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up this pamphlets on how to get pregnant."
Jack Geller,9,1,11,4,"Sorry to bother you again, but could you pass my pamphlets back? Thank you."
Mike Hannigan,9,3,7,3,Yeah?
Mike Hannigan,9,3,8,1,"I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I should be open and taking some risks."
Mike Hannigan,9,3,8,3,I am Mike.
Mike Hannigan,9,3,8,8,"How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me that."
Mike Hannigan,9,3,8,10,"Yeah, we met in college. I mean, high school."
Mike Hannigan,9,3,8,12,"Well, I'm a lawyer."
Mike Hannigan,9,3,8,14,"Actually, I just gave up my practice."
Mike Hannigan,9,3,8,16,"I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't do this now, I never will."
Mike Hannigan,9,3,11,3,"No, I didn't."
Mike Hannigan,9,3,11,7,'Days of Our Lives'! That's why you look so familiar!
Mike Hannigan,9,3,11,9,What?!
Mike Hannigan,9,3,11,14,Six!
Mike Hannigan,9,3,11,18,"I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his mother with a car."
Mike Hannigan,9,3,11,24,It was nice meeting you!
Mike Hannigan,9,3,13,1,"Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can we talk?"
Mike Hannigan,9,3,13,3,"I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny guy."
Mike Hannigan,9,3,13,5,"Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't. And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did."
Mike Hannigan,9,3,13,7,"My name in Mike, and I do play piano."
Mike Hannigan,9,3,13,9,There isn't a piano here.
Mike Hannigan,9,3,13,13,Really?
Mike Hannigan,9,3,13,15,That's great. What kind of music do you play?
Mike Hannigan,9,3,13,17,"Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could..."
Mike Hannigan,9,3,13,19,Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you out?
Mike Hannigan,9,4,1,20,Phoebe what's wrong?
Mike Hannigan,9,4,1,23,its Mike Hanagen.
Mike Hannigan,9,4,1,25,"Hey, so are you sure your ready to go."
Mike Hannigan,9,4,5,2,Sure who are you?
Mike Hannigan,9,4,5,4,Oh.
Mike Hannigan,9,4,5,6,"Ok, unless you're not gonna try to get me to join a cult are you?"
Mike Hannigan,9,4,5,8,oh it's just you have that look.
Mike Hannigan,9,4,5,10,what's up is Phoebe ok?
Mike Hannigan,9,4,5,12,that's why she was weird.
Mike Hannigan,9,4,5,14,"I'm not blowing her off, I actually just got off the phone with her, were going out tomorrow night, I mean I hope that's ok with you stranger from the coffee house."
Mike Hannigan,9,4,5,16,hey wait wait wait wait wait! Is that true what you said Phoebe's never had a serious relationship?
Mike Hannigan,9,4,5,18,but you did say it.
Mike Hannigan,9,4,5,20,Vicrum?
Mike Hannigan,9,4,8,18,"You know I'm trying to think of the last time I opened a door and you weren't there, Phoebe are you ok?"
Mike Hannigan,9,4,10,2,But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross.
Mike Hannigan,9,4,10,4,that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.
Mike Hannigan,9,4,10,6,"I just think there's somebody better out there for you, I mean I'm not saying me but. maybe me."
Mike Hannigan,9,4,10,8,"and you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with me. although I do smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway I just think I can make you happy."
Mike Hannigan,9,4,10,10,what's wrong?
Mike Hannigan,9,4,10,12,uh huh.
Mike Hannigan,9,4,10,14,No. well look can I think your weird and also cool for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you.
Mike Hannigan,9,4,10,16,Definitely.
Judy Geller,9,5,10,4,"I understand, separation is hard. One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his clothes, tucked his ??? between his legs and cried out: ""Mommy, I'm a girl, take me with you."""
Mike Hannigan,9,6,2,1,This is nice.
Mike Hannigan,9,6,2,3,You need both hands for that?
Mike Hannigan,9,6,2,7,Is it?
Mike Hannigan,9,6,2,9,"Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have this... No, not... that's gum. Ooh, five bucks... I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there..."
Mike Hannigan,9,6,2,11,"Oh, sorry."
Mike Hannigan,9,6,2,13,It's to my apartment.
Mike Hannigan,9,6,2,15,"Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because..."
Mike Hannigan,9,6,2,17,"Oh, thank God."
Mike Hannigan,9,6,2,19,"Is this cool, huh?"
Mike Hannigan,9,6,11,7,"Well... hey, the key works...!"
Mike Hannigan,9,6,13,1,So... how many guys have your key?
Mike Hannigan,9,6,13,3,Your lipstick's on his mouth.
Mike Hannigan,9,6,13,6,Did you uhm...
Mike Hannigan,9,6,13,8,...kiss him?
Mike Hannigan,9,6,13,11,Don't point your finger at me.
Mike Hannigan,9,6,13,13,Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about it...
Mike Hannigan,9,6,13,16,"Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd better watch out."
Mike Hannigan,9,6,13,18,"Well, I might."
Mike Hannigan,9,6,13,22,"Hey, what are you kidding me?"
Mike Hannigan,9,6,13,25,It's never gonna happen again right?
Mike Hannigan,9,7,6,1,Wow! You look like... like my mom.
Mike Hannigan,9,7,6,3,Great! Come on in!
Mike Hannigan,9,7,6,5,"No, my parents are rich."
Mike Hannigan,9,7,6,7,"Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents: Theodore and Bitsy."
Mike Hannigan,9,7,6,15,Hey... Wh... What are you doing?
Mike Hannigan,9,7,6,17,"Yeah, I'm sure they will, but you don't have to do this... I'm wanting them to get to know Phoebe, not Phoebe..."
Mike Hannigan,9,7,6,19,"Well, come on..."
Mike Hannigan,9,7,7,2,"No, no, no, you're doing fine, really... Why don't you go talk to my dad?"
Mike Hannigan,9,7,7,4,Absolutely! Or maybe just a little less pimp spit.
Mike Hannigan,9,7,7,17,Uhm... Did you just hit my dad?
Mike Hannigan,9,7,7,19,"But, I mean, you have met... humans before, right? Look, why don't you go talk to my mom?"
Mike Hannigan,9,7,7,21,"Yeah, you do that, and I go check my dad for signs of internal bleeding."
Mike Hannigan,9,7,7,32,Awesome!
Mike Hannigan,9,7,10,2,Phoebe writes lots of great songs. Wha... What was that one you sang the other night that everybody just loved?
Mike Hannigan,9,7,10,4,No...
Mike Hannigan,9,7,10,6,Stop!
Mike Hannigan,9,7,10,8,"Mom, I thought I told you... Phoebe's a vegetarian."
Mike Hannigan,9,7,10,11,Phoebe you don't have to eat...
Mike Hannigan,9,7,10,13,So...? What do you think?
Mike Hannigan,9,7,12,3,"Hey, what's going on?"
Mike Hannigan,9,7,12,5,A little better.
Mike Hannigan,9,7,12,8,I'm not interested.
Mike Hannigan,9,7,12,10,"All right, stop! You know, all Phoebe has done tonight is trying to get you to like her. And maybe that hasn't been clear all the time, but she did her best. And yeah... She's a little different than you are..."
Mike Hannigan,9,7,12,12,"So what? I mean if even I can get past that, it shouldn't bother you. And you don't have to like her. You just have to accept the fact that I do. I mean, if you even can't be civil to the woman I love..."
Mike Hannigan,9,7,12,15,The woman I love... I love you... Which is probably something I shouldn't say for the first time in front of my parents... and Tom and Sue...Who are by the way the most sinfully boring I've ever met in my life...
Mike Hannigan,9,7,12,17,You do?
Mike Hannigan,9,7,12,19,Wanna get out of here?
Mike Hannigan,9,7,12,21,"Mom, dad, thanks for dinner."
Mike Hannigan,9,9,2,21,Bye.
Mike Hannigan,9,9,2,23,I got beer.
Mike Hannigan,9,9,2,25,"Eh, why don't we start with the beer?"
Mike Hannigan,9,9,2,27,Yeah.
Mike Hannigan,9,9,2,29,Ah? Do you have one here?
Mike Hannigan,9,9,2,31,Okay.
Mike Hannigan,9,9,2,33,"Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't . . . I don't really like to talk about it."
Mike Hannigan,9,9,2,35,"So, you're a paleontologist, right?"
Mike Hannigan,9,9,2,37,My cousin's a paleontologist.
Mike Hannigan,9,9,8,1,"So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the same thing. Fascinating isn't it."
Mike Hannigan,9,9,8,3,I'll get it. Hello? Ross's place. Mike speaking. It's for you.
Mike Hannigan,9,9,10,3,Hey.
Mike Hannigan,9,9,10,5,Stout. That's a kind of beer.
Mike Hannigan,9,12,2,2,Lima.
Mike Hannigan,9,12,2,4,"You know, kinda think of it, the capital of Peru IS ""vtox"". Oh god! Oh!"
Mike Hannigan,9,12,2,6,"OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a rat in your cupboard."
Mike Hannigan,9,12,2,8,"What, is he your pet rat?"
Mike Hannigan,9,12,2,10,"You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary, and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus."
Mike Hannigan,9,12,2,12,I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have to get rid of it!
Mike Hannigan,9,12,2,14,Thank you.
Mike Hannigan,9,12,5,2,Hey P.
Mike Hannigan,9,12,5,4,Setting rat traps.
Mike Hannigan,9,12,5,6,"No, no, to test his neck strength."
Mike Hannigan,9,12,5,8,"Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps."
Mike Hannigan,9,12,5,10,Better think of a new name for him.
Mike Hannigan,9,12,5,12,"I don't know, I mean I'm not sure ..."
Mike Hannigan,9,12,5,14,"Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse."
Mike Hannigan,9,12,9,17,Yeah. We have rat babies now.
Mike Hannigan,9,12,11,2,"Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats?"
Mike Hannigan,9,12,11,4,"Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them?"
Mike Hannigan,9,12,11,6,"Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a ""love the one you're with"" kind of animals."
Mike Hannigan,9,12,11,8,"Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives."
Mike Hannigan,9,12,11,10,It's gonna be ok.
Mike Hannigan,9,12,11,12,"No, I think you're sweet."
Mike Hannigan,9,13,6,2,"Oh she's my girlfriend. That's not just how we do it here. I got to get a break and when we come back we've got Kennethsinging ""I touch myself""...I'm not here to judge!"
Mike Hannigan,9,13,6,13,Well I've got a book around...
Mike Hannigan,9,13,8,1,"All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of ""I touch myself"". Coming up next we've got Monicasinging ""Delta Dawn""."
Mike Hannigan,9,13,8,6,Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.
Mike Hannigan,9,13,10,4,Sure.
Mike Hannigan,9,13,10,7,Also a good gift? Underwear.
Mike Hannigan,9,16,2,1,I'm gonna go.
Mike Hannigan,9,16,2,3,I haven't been home in a couple of days and I need to get some more clothes.
Mike Hannigan,9,16,2,5,I put that tube top on as a joke.
Mike Hannigan,9,16,2,7,I want to stay too but I've gone as bad as much use out of these boxers as I can..
Mike Hannigan,9,16,2,9,Done it. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
Mike Hannigan,9,16,2,11,Me too. You know what? I just realised something. I don't wanna go home.
Mike Hannigan,9,16,2,13,"No, no! What I mean is, I hate going back to my apartment now... and partly because I live above a known crack den but... mostly because when I'm there, It's just, I really miss you. So.. do you want to move in together?"
Mike Hannigan,9,16,2,15,So we're doing it?
Mike Hannigan,9,16,2,17,Yeah!
Mike Hannigan,9,16,4,2,Phoebe and I are moving in together.
Mike Hannigan,9,16,4,7,I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Mike Hannigan,9,16,4,9,Yes dear.
Mike Hannigan,9,16,4,19,You ready to go?
Mike Hannigan,9,16,4,22,What are you talking about?
Mike Hannigan,9,16,7,1,"Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica's little ""groomy"" joke."
Mike Hannigan,9,16,7,3,"I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is... maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together, you're not expecting a proposal, right?"
Mike Hannigan,9,16,7,5,"Yeah well, that's the thing. For me it's as far as it can ever go."
Mike Hannigan,9,16,7,7,"Look. Phoebe, I-I love you. Very much. But I never want to get married again."
Mike Hannigan,9,16,7,9,"It's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. I kind of lost faith in the whole idea."
Mike Hannigan,9,16,7,11,At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....
Mike Hannigan,9,16,7,13,Look it's not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!
Mike Hannigan,9,16,7,15,"Look Phoebe, It's not about you. I just never wanna get married again."
Mike Hannigan,9,16,7,17,I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.
Mike Hannigan,9,16,7,19,"Trust me, I will never..."
Mike Hannigan,9,16,13,3,Very cool.
Mike Hannigan,9,16,13,18,No but... You don't want to get married either right?
Mike Hannigan,9,16,13,21,You wanna get married?
Mike Hannigan,9,16,13,25,But if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before?
Mike Hannigan,9,16,13,27,I want to live with you too! Let's do that!
Mike Hannigan,9,16,13,29,Can we at least try living together? I mean you might change your mind about marriage.
Mike Hannigan,9,16,13,31,No.
Mike Hannigan,9,16,13,33,But I don't want this to end.
Mike Hannigan,9,16,13,35,I can't believe this is gonna end. I guess I'll have my stuff packed up.
Mike Hannigan,9,16,13,37,Ok... so... Goodbye.
Mike Hannigan,9,17,8,11,Phoebe called me.
Mike Hannigan,9,17,8,17,"Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see..."
Mike Hannigan,9,17,8,19,"Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!"
Mike Hannigan,9,17,8,25,So how've you been?
Mike Hannigan,9,17,8,27,You look really beautiful.
Mike Hannigan,9,17,8,31,Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you.
Mike Hannigan,9,17,11,3,"I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night."
Mike Hannigan,9,17,11,5,"It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time... I never would have stopped."
Mike Hannigan,9,17,11,11,"Oh, crap!"
Mike Hannigan,9,17,11,13,My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,2,27,"Oh, hi. I'm professor Wealer."
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,2,29,It's a... It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around.
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,2,33,"And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis."
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,2,37,"Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us?"
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,2,39,"I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?"
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,2,41,You don't think we should wait for him?
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,4,8,"Kinda playing fast and loose with the word ""interesting""."
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,4,10,Oh my God!!
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,4,12,Let's ditch him!
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,4,14,"Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you!"
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,4,16,"Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok, let's go!!"
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,5,5,"Well, I think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas..."
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,5,7,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me."
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,5,16,"Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry."
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,5,34,I thought you came to say you were sick.
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,8,13,"Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone."
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,8,15,"Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with."
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,8,17,Yeah...
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,8,19,"Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man."
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,8,21,"Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues..."
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,8,23,"Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him."
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,8,25,A guy who won two.
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,8,27,Yeah... for three years.
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,8,29,... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.
Charlie Wheeler,9,20,8,31,"No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant."
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,1,17,"Oh, you know what? I'll come with you!"
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,1,21,"I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really hope you don't think less of me."
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,1,23,"You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean, Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors, and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you know, very cerebral..."
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,4,3,Hi!
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,4,5,I'm good!
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,4,7,"Please, I've been crazed all day! I had a meeting with the Dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and I'm writing the Foreword for a friend's book..."
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,4,9,So I am just so excited to be here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city!
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,4,11,"Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun!"
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,4,13,"Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher Hall."
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,4,15,And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display at the public library.
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,4,17,"And first, I have to see the MET!"
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,4,19,"No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!"
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,4,21,The museum!
Janice Litman Goralnik,9,21,7,8,OH MY GOD!!
Janice Litman Goralnik,9,21,7,10,Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this!
Janice Litman Goralnik,9,21,7,13,"Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we..."
Janice Litman Goralnik,9,21,7,15,Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in a cup! Oh! They gave you the kiddy size .
Janice Litman Goralnik,9,21,7,19,Please... go! Just let me know if you need a hand!
Janice Litman Goralnik,9,21,10,2,Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?
Janice Litman Goralnik,9,21,10,4,"That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,9,21,10,6,"Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is."
Janice Litman Goralnik,9,21,10,8,"Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine."
Janice Litman Goralnik,9,21,10,10,"What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?"
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,12,3,Hi!
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,12,5,The museum was amazing!
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,12,7,"Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense."
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,12,9,"Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around."
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,12,11,"No, we went to the left."
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,12,13,"Yeah, it's fun ."
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,12,15,"Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird."
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,12,17,"Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common with. You know what I mean?"
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,12,19,"Yeah, I guess that's true."
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,12,21,He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,12,25,Hey!
Charlie Wheeler,9,21,12,27,"Yeah, let's go. Thanks Ross."
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,1,1,Oh! That feels sooo good!
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,1,3,"I'm sorry, what?"
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,1,5,From... Cosmo??
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,1,7,"So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!"
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,1,14,I'm sure you have better things to do.
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,1,16,"If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help."
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,2,2,"Oh, yeah! Let's do it!"
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,2,8,Umh... Kurts Baley?
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,2,11,So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions?
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,2,13,He's a pretty tough guy to impress.
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,2,23,"We'll see you, guys!"
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,4,6,"So, you know what, I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. Where do you think those would be?"
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,4,8,"See, I told you I needed someone! Oh, you know, by the way, as a ""thank you"", I would really love to take you out."
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,4,10,"Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, wanna come?"
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,4,12,You've seen all the movies...
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,4,17,"Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!"
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,9,6,Oh! trying on clothes.
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,9,8,Rachel... I heard you guys whispering.
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,9,10,No! There's nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey.
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,9,12,"It's just that... I don't understand it... I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?"
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,9,14,Wow!
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,9,16,"You know, by the way. I heard you tell her not to do anything. Thanks for sticking up for me. You are such a nice person."
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,12,30,"Hey, there's Phoebe! Is that Mike she's with?"
Charlie Wheeler,9,22,12,32,There's a third guy?
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,1,16,Wow! This place is beautiful!
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,4,4,I didn't mean a thong... I meant thongs...
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,4,11,Oh my God! Did you talk to him?
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,4,15,Yeah!
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,4,17,Oh I can't... I have seminars all day and I promised Ross I would look at his speech.
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,4,19,But maybe we can have dinner later? On the balcony? Will be romantic.
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,4,21,I will if you will.
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,4,24,So you'll be ok?
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,4,29,"There's an indoor pool, you can swim there!"
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,7,2,It's great. You're gonna be the hit of the conference.
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,7,7,Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic!
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,7,12,Actually the wet season is June to December.
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,7,41,"Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night!"
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,7,43,"Oh wait, Joey and I are supposed to have dinner ."
Mike Hannigan,9,23,8,1,Hello?
Mike Hannigan,9,23,8,3,Who is this?
Mike Hannigan,9,23,8,5,He... he's gonna propose?
Mike Hannigan,9,23,8,7,"Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you."
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,10,1,"And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century."
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,10,3,Yeah.
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,10,5,Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech.
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,10,7,Thank you.
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,10,9,"Oh yeah! Hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you."
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,10,11,"Oh, this is such a cute picture of Emma. And is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation?"
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,10,13,Your first marriage?
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,10,15,You're married more than once?
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,10,17,"So, why did you break up?"
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,10,19,"Oh my God, this is so cool!"
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,10,21,"No, it's just... I was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay!"
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,10,23,Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fiance was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner.
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,10,25,"Right and then everybody finds out and they're like: ""Oh, I knew all along"""
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,10,27,I know!
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,10,29,I didn't do that.
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,11,21,"I just left you a message! Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner."
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,11,24,I had a great time.
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,11,27,"So, shall we?"
Charlie Wheeler,9,23,11,30,Bye.
Mike Hannigan,9,23,12,14,Hi David. Chandler. Monica... Oh!
Mike Hannigan,9,23,12,16,Hi Phoebe.
Mike Hannigan,9,23,12,18,I have a question I need to ask you.
Mike Hannigan,9,23,12,20,"Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this."
Mike Hannigan,9,23,12,22,"Actually yeah, that'll be great."
Mike Hannigan,9,23,12,24,"Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you."
Mike Hannigan,9,23,12,26,"Sorry David, but she really has to know this."
Mike Hannigan,9,23,12,35,We can have any future you want.
Mike Hannigan,9,23,12,41,Is it ok if I hug you now?
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,2,8,What?
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,2,10,"You're... you're kidding, right?"
Mike Hannigan,9,24,3,14,"You're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!"
Mike Hannigan,9,24,3,15,Oh... I'm back!
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,3,19,You were incredible!
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,3,21,You blew them away!
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,3,23,I was not!
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,3,25,Oh my God! I'm your groupie!
Mike Hannigan,9,24,4,4,They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,5,2,Hey! There you are!
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,5,4,"I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon."
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,5,6,You know... I feel so bad! I haven't seen you this whole trip and especially last night...
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,5,8,"Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!"
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,5,10,Yeah...
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,5,11,... is it weird that it's not with each other?
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,5,13,I think we need to talk...!
Mike Hannigan,9,24,6,8,I'll play ya!
Mike Hannigan,9,24,6,12,I think I will be all right! You wanna volley a bit for a serve?
Mike Hannigan,9,24,6,15,"Oh, by the way... I'm awesome!!"
Mike Hannigan,9,24,6,17,You're ready to play?
Mike Hannigan,9,24,6,21,Wanna make it more interesting?
Mike Hannigan,9,24,6,23,Ten bucks a game?
Mike Hannigan,9,24,6,25,I'll make it a hundred!
Mike Hannigan,9,24,6,28,"To see who goes first, you got a quarter?"
Mike Hannigan,9,24,6,36,"Oh, no! I don't think so! You know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point."
Mike Hannigan,9,24,9,2,Do you?
Mike Hannigan,9,24,9,4,Do you?
Mike Hannigan,9,24,9,6,DO YOU?
Mike Hannigan,9,24,9,14,"Game, point!"
Mike Hannigan,9,24,9,16,"You know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that."
Mike Hannigan,9,24,9,18,And that's how it's done!
Mike Hannigan,9,24,9,21,That's what I'm thinking.
Mike Hannigan,9,24,9,24,": Serve the ball, chump."
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,10,6,"Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?"
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,10,8,"Uh, well... Joey and I broke up."
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,10,10,"Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!"
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,10,12,"Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best."
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,10,14,I guess. There was hum... there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey. I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone else.
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,10,17,"Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?"
Mike Hannigan,9,24,11,2,"Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41."
Mike Hannigan,9,24,11,14,So you forfeit?
Mike Hannigan,9,24,11,21,"Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat."
Mike Hannigan,9,24,11,28,Ok!
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,12,1,Thanks!
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,12,3,Are they still looking for us?
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,12,6,I don't think they did.
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,12,7,"Hum, so, I started to say you something earlier, hum... There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I... was starting to have feelings... for someone else."
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,12,9,I think you know.
Charlie Wheeler,9,24,12,12,"All right, all right."
Charlie Wheeler,10,1,1,14,Ooh... Dr. Geller!
Charlie Wheeler,10,1,1,50,uhm... Is everything okay?
Charlie Wheeler,10,1,1,52,"Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could just..."
Charlie Wheeler,10,1,1,54,I uhm... I completely understand.
Charlie Wheeler,10,1,1,56,Okay...
Charlie Wheeler,10,1,2,9,"So, did you talk to Joey?"
Charlie Wheeler,10,1,2,11,"Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller!"
Charlie Wheeler,10,1,2,13,PHD.
Charlie Wheeler,10,1,2,25,It's so... something... You go girlfriend!
Charlie Wheeler,10,1,2,27,Not once.
Mike Hannigan,10,1,3,9,"You should be careful when checking your overhead bins, 'cause items may shift during..."
Mike Hannigan,10,1,3,11,"You don't have to go home tonight, do you?"
Mike Hannigan,10,1,3,13,Oh...
Mike Hannigan,10,1,3,15,Uhm... I can't do anything tonight.
Mike Hannigan,10,1,3,17,I have a date.
Mike Hannigan,10,1,3,19,"Oh, it's... my girlfriend."
Mike Hannigan,10,1,3,21,"Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started seeing someone."
Mike Hannigan,10,1,3,23,Three months.
Mike Hannigan,10,1,3,25,I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I promise.
Mike Hannigan,10,1,3,27,Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the packing material...
Charlie Wheeler,10,1,3,30,Okay... Good luck.
Mike Hannigan,10,1,4,2,"Hey, it's Mike."
Mike Hannigan,10,1,4,4,"Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone..."
Mike Hannigan,10,1,4,6,One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.
Mike Hannigan,10,1,4,8,"Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up."
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,3,16,"Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about. When we're in a public place, there are certain rules."
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,3,17,That's not what we talked about!!
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,3,19,Hey.
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,3,21,"Good to see you, too."
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,3,23,"Hi, how you doin'?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,3,26,"Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's Leslie throwing bagels at him."
Charlie Wheeler,10,2,4,8,"Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?"
Charlie Wheeler,10,2,4,11,Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.
Charlie Wheeler,10,2,4,13,"And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want."
Charlie Wheeler,10,2,4,20,"Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little..."
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,5,2,"Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again."
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,5,4,Yeah.
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,5,6,I haven't slept in four years!
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,5,8,"You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's three of them, Phoebe, three!"
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,5,10,"Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it, it's too horrible. No."
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,5,12,"No, I can't."
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,5,14,"Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one."
Charlie Wheeler,10,2,7,10,"Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging alcoholic."
Charlie Wheeler,10,2,7,11,"Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,8,2,"No, of course we're not."
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,8,4,I know.
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,8,6,"Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've got her onboard."
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,8,8,Huh.
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,8,10,"Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know, he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke."
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,8,12,"What's green and says ""hey, I'm a frog""? A talking frog! Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny."
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,8,14,"Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet."
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,8,16,"Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor.."
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,8,18,"Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies."
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,8,20,How about tomorrow?
Frank Buffay Jr.,10,2,8,22,You'd do that for us?
Charlie Wheeler,10,2,10,10,"Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off."
Charlie Wheeler,10,2,10,12,"I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely."
Charlie Wheeler,10,2,10,14,"You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?"
Charlie Wheeler,10,2,10,16,Alright.
Charlie Wheeler,10,2,10,17,"God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so.."
Charlie Wheeler,10,2,10,19,Bye.
Jack Geller,10,4,2,40,I can't believe Emma is already one!
Judy Geller,10,4,2,41,I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to take him to the emergency room!
Jack Geller,10,4,2,44,Thank you!
Jack Geller,10,4,2,46,Which one are you?
Judy Geller,10,4,3,1,Hello Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday.
Jack Geller,10,4,3,2,"Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years."
Judy Geller,10,4,3,3,"Yes, you'll be all grown up by then. We'll be... Well your grandfather and I might not be here."
Jack Geller,10,4,3,4,"That's true! This message could becoming to you from beyond the grave, Emma!"
Judy Geller,10,4,3,5,"After all, my parents died very young."
Jack Geller,10,4,3,6,And my cholesterol's off the charts!
Judy Geller,10,4,3,7,"Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!"
Judy Geller,10,4,3,21,"Jack, look at this."
Jack Geller,10,4,3,22,"I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!"
Judy Geller,10,4,3,56,"Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane."
Jack Geller,10,4,3,57,Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime.
Judy Geller,10,4,3,58,"Anyway, it was lovely seeing you."
Judy Geller,10,4,3,60,Bye... Bye dear.
Judy Geller,10,4,3,62,Nighty-night!
Charlie Wheeler,10,5,2,1,Hey!
Charlie Wheeler,10,5,2,3,"So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to..."
Charlie Wheeler,10,5,2,5,"Fine, it's fine... I'll just shower by myself..."
Charlie Wheeler,10,5,2,7,"Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue."
Charlie Wheeler,10,5,2,15,Hi!
Charlie Wheeler,10,5,2,17,Nice to meet you.
Mike Hannigan,10,5,5,2,I know. This has been the best year... THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE!
Mike Hannigan,10,5,5,4,I FEEL THE SAME WAY!
Mike Hannigan,10,5,5,8,Really?
Mike Hannigan,10,5,5,10,Excuse me... .
Mike Hannigan,10,5,11,1,"Great game, huh?"
Mike Hannigan,10,5,11,3,Why do you keep looking at the screen?
Mike Hannigan,10,5,11,5,Going go to the bathroom.
Mike Hannigan,10,5,11,7,Why?
Mike Hannigan,10,5,13,2,"But please, let's just forget the whole thing."
Mike Hannigan,10,5,13,5,Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it?
Mike Hannigan,10,5,13,7,No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
Mike Hannigan,10,5,13,8,I'm gonna do this now.
Mike Hannigan,10,5,13,10,"Phoebe, I..."
Mike Hannigan,10,5,13,12,Ready?
Mike Hannigan,10,5,13,14,"Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?"
Mike Hannigan,10,5,13,16,I love you!
Mike Hannigan,10,5,13,18,Not possible! She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls.
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,3,2,Hey!
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,3,4,"Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations!"
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,3,6,"Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!"
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,3,8,Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,3,10,Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,3,12,Yeah.
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,3,14,"No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner together, and I can introduce you."
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,3,16,"Yes, absolutely. I'll call him."
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,3,18,Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,6,2,"Sorry, looks like it's just him."
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,6,6,Me too.
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,6,8,I'm sorry... Ross Geller... Benjamin Hobart.
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,6,11,Shall we? .
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,6,13,"Oh my God, I completely forgot! Oh my God! I can't believe they let us back in this place! ."
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,6,16,"Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal, while I go to the ladies room?"
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,16,2,Did you get the grant?
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,16,4,What?
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,16,6,"Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man."
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,16,8,"I'm sure he was just joking, Ross."
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,16,10,Seriously?
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,16,12,"Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then M-B-O..."
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,17,5,Benji?
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,17,8,I can't believe this.
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,17,11,Yes!
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,17,13,"I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so.... romantic."
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,17,16,Maybe...
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,17,18,"Oh God! I am so sorry, but... I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know..."
Charlie Wheeler,10,6,17,21,I love you too!
Mike Hannigan,10,7,1,5,"Oh, figuring out our wedding plans."
Mike Hannigan,10,7,1,13,I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.
Mike Hannigan,10,7,1,16,Are you serious?
Mike Hannigan,10,7,1,18,I think it would make me wanna marry you even more.
Mike Hannigan,10,7,3,7,Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.
Mike Hannigan,10,7,3,10,Not necessary.
Mike Hannigan,10,7,3,12,"And ""X"" is spelled uhm... ""Mike Hannigan""."
Mike Hannigan,10,7,3,15,It does. It feels really good!
Mike Hannigan,10,7,7,1,We're seriously asking for our money back?
Mike Hannigan,10,7,7,5,"Oh my God, I love your shirt!"
Mike Hannigan,10,7,7,10,Yeah! This feels really good.
Mike Hannigan,10,7,7,14,She could have been talking about either one of us.
Mike Hannigan,10,7,11,1,"You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm sorry about that."
Mike Hannigan,10,7,11,3,"Well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really deserve that."
Mike Hannigan,10,7,11,5,"No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there."
Mike Hannigan,10,7,11,7,"Alright, fine. We'll give the money back."
Mike Hannigan,10,7,12,3,"No, no, we're here to give the money back."
Mike Hannigan,10,7,12,7,"Ok, look! Enough! Alright? I'm stepping in. I'm putting my foot down! As your future husband I'm going to make this decision for us. Now... what do you think we should do?"
Mike Hannigan,10,7,12,9,What?
Mike Hannigan,10,7,12,15,"Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come back in a few years and make an even bigger donation."
Mike Hannigan,10,12,3,8,Thanks for coming you guys.
Mike Hannigan,10,12,3,10,Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?
Mike Hannigan,10,12,3,12,Yeah.
Mike Hannigan,10,12,3,49,"Hey guys, how is it going?"
Mike Hannigan,10,12,3,51,"Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it."
Mike Hannigan,10,12,3,54,"...and I was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys..."
Mike Hannigan,10,12,3,57,You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one.
Mike Hannigan,10,12,3,60,"You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose."
Mike Hannigan,10,12,4,2,"Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that."
Mike Hannigan,10,12,4,4,I intend to marry her.
Mike Hannigan,10,12,4,6,No more so than acting.
Mike Hannigan,10,12,4,8,"You're right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?"
Mike Hannigan,10,12,4,22,Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?
Mike Hannigan,10,12,4,24,Is that what you say to Chandler?
Mike Hannigan,10,12,6,3,Hey.
Mike Hannigan,10,12,6,5,Orchids?
Mike Hannigan,10,12,6,8,Joseph.
Mike Hannigan,10,12,6,10,This is... great...
Mike Hannigan,10,12,6,12,Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?
Mike Hannigan,10,12,6,14,"Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?"
Mike Hannigan,10,12,6,16,"Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her."
Mike Hannigan,10,12,6,18,That must have been one lousy movie.
Mike Hannigan,10,12,8,3,"Yes. Yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice. That didn't make me uncomfortable at all! Alright, so I'll see everybody tonight?"
Mike Hannigan,10,12,8,6,"Uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall?"
Mike Hannigan,10,12,9,18,"Hey, I forgot my scarf."
Mike Hannigan,10,12,9,20,"Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy."
Mike Hannigan,10,12,10,11,I think I wanna get married to you today.
Mike Hannigan,10,12,11,3,"Hey! You made it. Great! Chappy! Hi! Hi! Mom, I know getting married in the street isn't something you approve of..."
Mike Hannigan,10,12,11,6,"You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle."
Mike Hannigan,10,12,11,8,I guess.
Mike Hannigan,10,12,11,14,"Oh, no!"
Mike Hannigan,10,12,11,50,My God! Aren't you freezing?
Mike Hannigan,10,12,11,55,"Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever."
Mike Hannigan,10,12,11,57,I love you too.
Mike Hannigan,10,12,11,64,I do.
Mike Hannigan,10,14,1,1,Thank you guys for having us over.
Mike Hannigan,10,14,2,8,Here you go.
Mike Hannigan,10,14,2,10,"Oh, it's just... It's up to you. It's your name. You've got to live with it."
Mike Hannigan,10,14,2,28,You're a strange kind of grown-up.
Mike Hannigan,10,14,2,30,Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that right now?
Mike Hannigan,10,14,7,1,Hey.
Mike Hannigan,10,14,7,3,Ah! I missed you.
Mike Hannigan,10,14,7,5,"So, what's new?"
Mike Hannigan,10,14,7,7,That's great! You changed you name?
Mike Hannigan,10,14,7,9,You're kidding right?
Mike Hannigan,10,14,7,11,You really did that?
Mike Hannigan,10,14,7,13,"Yeah, but you can't do that."
Mike Hannigan,10,14,7,15,"Alright, then I'm gonna change my name."
Mike Hannigan,10,14,7,17,Crap Bag.
Mike Hannigan,10,14,7,19,"No, no Mike, just Crap Bag. First name Crap, last name Bag."
Mike Hannigan,10,14,7,21,"Yeah, I'm serious. It's fun, it's different and no-one else has a name like that!"
Mike Hannigan,10,14,7,23,"I do love it, and I love your name. I love Princess Consuela."
Mike Hannigan,10,14,11,1,"After you, miss Banana Hammock."
Mike Hannigan,10,14,11,5,Oh! Why don't you introduce me?
Mike Hannigan,10,14,11,9,Why don't you tell her my name?
Mike Hannigan,10,14,11,12,"If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap."
Mike Hannigan,10,14,11,15,Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.
Mike Hannigan,10,14,11,17,Really?
Mike Hannigan,10,14,11,19,Do you even know what a banana hammock is?
Mike Hannigan,10,14,11,21,It's a Speedo.
Janice Litman Goralnik,10,15,6,11,Oh my God! .
Janice Litman Goralnik,10,15,8,1,What a small world!
Janice Litman Goralnik,10,15,8,4,"Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! . So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie."
Janice Litman Goralnik,10,15,8,9,"Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it! Ellen, we're going to talk numbers."
Janice Litman Goralnik,10,15,11,1,"Well... I just talked to Sid, we are definitely putting in an offer on the house... a-a-and I'll bet we get it."
Janice Litman Goralnik,10,15,11,3,"All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see you later, neighbor."
Janice Litman Goralnik,10,15,11,5,"Oh, me too..."
Janice Litman Goralnik,10,15,11,7,Huh?
Janice Litman Goralnik,10,15,11,9,Oh... my...
Janice Litman Goralnik,10,15,11,11,"Chandler, what are you talking about?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,10,15,11,13,"I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us."
Janice Litman Goralnik,10,15,11,15,"But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't think we should get this house now."
Janice Litman Goralnik,10,15,11,17,"Chandler, one of us has got to be strong."
Janice Litman Goralnik,10,15,11,19,"Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... Goodbye Chandler Bing."
Mike Hannigan,10,17,9,18,Hey!
Mike Hannigan,10,17,9,20,"Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but.."
Mike Hannigan,10,17,9,49,I want one.
Mike Hannigan,10,17,9,51,Seriously. Wanna make one of those?
Mike Hannigan,10,17,9,53,Really?
