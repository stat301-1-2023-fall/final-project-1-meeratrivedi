And Rog.,Roger,1,13,4,12

"I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...",Roger,1,13,4,23

"Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.",Gloria Tribbiani,1,13,10,8
"Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else.

I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.",Gloria Tribbiani,1,13,10,10

"Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.",Roger,1,13,11,11
"Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.",Roger,1,13,11,13

Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.,Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,14,7
"No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.",Janice Litman Goralnik,1,14,14,9

"Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore.

"Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.",Grandmother,2,9,3,15
"It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.",Grandmother,2,9,3,17

That you enjoyed the occasional drink...ing binge.,Joanna,4,9,8,19

"I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies.

Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?,Judge,6,5,8,2
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.,Judge,6,5,8,4
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.,Judge,6,5,8,6
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?,Judge,6,5,8,11
"And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.",Judge,6,5,8,14
That won't be necessary.,Judge,6,5,8,16
"Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.",Judge,6,5,8,19
"Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?",Judge,6,5,8,21
"Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment. If you two don't want to be together you'll have to file for divorce.",Judge,6,5,8,23
You need to get out of my chambers.,Judge,6,5,8,28
Would you like to spend the night in jail?,Judge,6,5,8,31
Maybe because you've got the keys?,Passerby,6,5,10,3

Is that supposed to be me?,Cecilia,7,15,8,19
Yeah but Jessica doesn't have an English accent.,Cecilia,7,15,8,21
"So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. You try.",Cecilia,7,15,10,2
"No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He's not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.",Cecilia,7,15,10,4
"Right. He's not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!!

"I probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y'know I just got so comfy here! And... Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!",Cecilia,7,15,10,10
"Well, let's just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!",Cecilia,7,15,10,12
"But... Well now, now's a different time for me.",Cecilia,7,15,10,14
You think I'm hot?,Cecilia,7,15,10,16
"Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the... So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face.",Cecilia,7,15,10,18
No! It's because that way the camera only sees her! Do you wanna try it?,Cecilia,7,15,10,20
"That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands maybe a little off, they should be maybe right like...",Cecilia,7,15,10,22

What?,Cecilia,7,15,12,30
They don't?,Cecilia,7,15,12,32
How does it happen?,Cecilia,7,15,12,34
Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!,Cecilia,7,15,12,36
"Loosening the saddle on mother's horse was brilliant Fredrick. And the electric fence, inspired.",Dina,7,15,14,2
Thank you sweetheart.,Fredrick,7,15,14,3
"I can't believe she's really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours.",Dina,7,15,14,4
Who are you?!,Dina,7,15,14,6
What's the matter Dina? Don't you recognize your own mother?!,Jessica Lockhart,7,15,14,7

I'm kind of funny looking.,Steve,9,14,8,4

"I'm not funny either. So, if you were thinking, ""well, he's not that good-looking, but maybe we'll have some laughs""... That ain't gonna happen.",Steve,9,14,8,8
I lost it. To drugs.,Steve,9,14,8,10
I silk-screen t-shirts now.,Steve,9,14,8,11

I do like my hair.,Steve,9,14,8,15
I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.,Waiter,9,14,11,1

What are you doing? Are you trying to get him to stay? Because you can't do that.,Waiter #2,9,14,11,7
"Just get out of here, okay?",Waiter,9,14,11,8
"Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home.",Waiter,9,14,11,10
"Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.",Waiter,9,14,11,12
I - I can't believe I'm crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.,Steve,9,14,13,1

"Just so I know, if I had asked first...",David,9,23,12,38
"Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip!",David,9,23,12,40
