Ross Geller,Mad,1,1,4,1,"I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,1,4,3,I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,1,4,4,It's a beautiful thing.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,1,4,5,What's this?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,1,4,6,I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,1,4,7,Which goes where?
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,1,4,8,I have no idea.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,1,4,10,Done with the bookcase!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,1,4,11,All finished!
Ross Geller,Sad,1,1,4,12,"This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,1,4,13,"Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here."
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,1,4,14,"Yes, please don't spoil all this fun."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,1,4,15,"Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?"
Ross Geller,Sad,1,1,4,16,You guys.
Chandler Bing,Sad,1,1,4,17,"Oh, God."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,1,4,18,You got screwed.
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,1,4,19,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,Mad,1,1,5,1,Oh my God!
Paul the Wine Guy,Sad,1,1,5,2,"I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?"
Monica Geller,Sad,1,1,5,3,"My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
Paul the Wine Guy,Powerful,1,1,5,4,"Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-"
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,1,5,5,-leg?
Paul the Wine Guy,Joyful,1,1,5,6,"That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch."
Monica Geller,Powerful,1,1,5,7,"You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel."
Paul the Wine Guy,Peaceful,1,1,5,8,"Ooh, steer clear of you."
Monica Geller,Powerful,1,1,5,9,That's right.
Ross Geller,Sad,1,1,7,1,I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,1,7,2,Shut up!
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,1,7,3,You must stop!
Ross Geller,Sad,1,1,7,4,That only took me an hour.
Chandler Bing,Sad,1,1,7,5,"Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!"
Ross Geller,Scared,1,1,7,6,"You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her..."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,1,1,7,7,"What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!"
Ross Geller,Scared,1,1,7,8,I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,1,7,9,Stay out of my freezer!
Paul the Wine Guy,Sad,1,1,8,1,"Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh..."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,1,8,2,"What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?"
Paul the Wine Guy,Sad,1,1,8,3,"No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,1,8,4,"Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?"
Paul the Wine Guy,Scared,1,1,8,5,Isn't there?
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,1,8,6,"Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?"
Paul the Wine Guy,Sad,1,1,8,7,"Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...Sexually."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,1,8,8,"Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry..."
Paul the Wine Guy,Sad,1,1,8,9,It's okay...
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,1,8,10,I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
Paul the Wine Guy,Neutral,1,1,8,11,Two years.
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,1,8,12,Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
Paul the Wine Guy,Neutral,1,1,8,13,"So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,1,8,14,"...Yeah. Yeah, I do."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,1,1,10,1,"Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,1,10,2,"Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,1,10,3,"Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,1,1,10,4,Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
Ross Geller,Sad,1,1,10,5,"Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?"
Franny,Joyful,1,1,12,1,"Hey, Monica!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,1,12,2,"Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?"
Franny,Neutral,1,1,12,3,"You had sex, didn't you?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,1,12,4,How do you do that?
Franny,Mad,1,1,12,5,"Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So? Who?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,1,12,6,You know Paul?
Franny,Neutral,1,1,12,7,"Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,1,12,8,You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
Franny,Neutral,1,1,12,9,"Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,1,13,1,Of course it was a line!
Monica Geller,Mad,1,1,13,2,"Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,1,13,3,I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
Monica Geller,Mad,1,1,13,4,I hate men! I hate men!
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,1,1,13,5,"Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe."
Monica Geller,Mad,1,1,13,6,Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,1,1,13,7,"All right, c'mere, gimme your feet."
Monica Geller,Sad,1,1,13,8,"I just thought he was nice, y'know?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,1,13,9,I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,1,13,11,Guess what?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,1,13,12,You got a job?
Rachel Green,Mad,1,1,13,13,Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,1,13,14,And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,1,13,15,"You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,1,13,16,"Oh, how well you know me..."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,1,13,17,"They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,1,13,18,How'd you pay for them?
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,1,13,19,"Uh, credit card."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,1,13,20,And who pays for that?
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,1,13,21,Um... my... father.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,1,15,1,I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,1,15,2,I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
Monica Geller,Scared,1,1,15,3,What? I-I said you had a-
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,1,15,4,What I said you had...
Monica Geller,Mad,1,1,15,5,Would you stop?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,1,15,6,"Oh, was I doing it again?"
#ALL#,Mad,1,1,15,7,Yes!
Monica Geller,Peaceful,1,1,15,8,"I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,1,15,9,"Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,1,15,10,There's an image.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,1,1,15,11,Would anybody like more coffee?
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,1,15,12,"Did you make it, or are you just serving it?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,1,15,13,I'm just serving it.
#ALL#,Joyful,1,1,15,14,"Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,1,1,15,15,"Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas."
Customer,Scared,1,1,15,16,"Ahh, miss? More coffee?"
Rachel Green,Mad,1,1,15,17,"Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,1,15,18,"Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-"
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,2,1,1,"What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,2,1,2,"Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,2,1,3,"Oh, yeah!"
Rachel Green,Powerful,1,2,1,4,Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
Monica Geller,Powerful,1,2,1,5,Absolutely.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,2,1,6,"Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,2,1,7,"Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket."
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,2,1,8,"The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake."
Rachel Green,Sad,1,2,1,9,"Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,2,1,10,....Are we still talking about sex?
Ross Geller,Scared,1,2,2,1,"No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?"
Marsha,Sad,1,2,2,2,"Well, she has issues."
Ross Geller,Scared,1,2,2,3,Does she.
Marsha,Mad,1,2,2,4,"He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,2,2,5,"Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?"
Marsha,Mad,1,2,2,6,"Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?"
Ross Geller,Scared,1,2,2,8,No. No.
Marsha,Joyful,1,2,2,9,"Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!"
Ross Geller,Scared,1,2,2,10,"Okay, okay, yes, it is. How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,2,2,12,Hi.
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,2,2,13,So.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,2,2,14,"You look great. I, uh... I hate that."
Carol Willick,Joyful,1,2,2,15,Sorry. You look good too.
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,2,2,16,"Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh..."
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,2,2,17,A lesbian?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,1,2,2,18,"Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?"
Carol Willick,Mad,1,2,2,19,"Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-"
Ross Geller,Scared,1,2,2,20,"Why- why are you here, Carol?"
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,2,2,21,I'm pregnant.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,2,2,22,Pregnant?!
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,2,6,1,"Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway."
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,2,6,3,Hi.
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,2,6,4,"Ross, you remember Susan."
Ross Geller,Mad,1,2,6,5,How could I forget?
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,2,6,6,Ross.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,2,6,7,"Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?"
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,2,6,8,Dr. Oberman.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,2,6,9,..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,2,6,10,She.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,2,6,11,"-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?"
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,2,6,12,"Yes, and she's very supportive."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,2,6,13,"Okay, that's great. No, I'm- Oh."
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,2,6,14,Thanks.
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,2,6,15,"Quack, quack.."
Carol Willick,Scared,1,2,6,16,Ross? That opens my cervix.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,2,7,1,Barry?
Barry Farber,Neutral,1,2,7,2,C'mon in.
Rachel Green,Scared,1,2,7,3,Are you sure?
Barry Farber,Neutral,1,2,7,4,"Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours."
Robbie,Scared,1,2,7,5,Huh?!
Barry Farber,Peaceful,1,2,7,6,"So, how ya doin?"
Rachel Green,Sad,1,2,7,7,I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
Barry Farber,Neutral,1,2,7,8,"Yeah, well.."
Bernice,Neutral,1,2,7,9,"Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging."
Barry Farber,Neutral,1,2,7,10,Be right there. Be back in a sec.
Rachel Green,Sad,1,2,7,12,I dumped him.
Robbie,Neutral,1,2,7,13,Okay.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,2,8,1,"So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?"
Carol Willick,Mad,1,2,8,2,Give me a 'for instance'.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,2,8,3,"Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?"
Carol Willick,Powerful,1,2,8,4,Marlon-
Ross Geller,Mad,1,2,8,5,Marlon?!
Carol Willick,Powerful,1,2,8,6,"-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl."
Ross Geller,Mad,1,2,8,7,...As in Mouse?
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,2,8,8,As in my grandmother.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,2,8,9,"Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?"
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,2,8,10,Julia..
Susan Bunch,Powerful,1,2,8,11,We agreed on Minnie.
Ross Geller,Powerful,1,2,8,12,"'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?"
Barry Farber,Neutral,1,2,9,1,Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
Rachel Green,Scared,1,2,9,2,"Oh, not much. I-I got a job."
Barry Farber,Joyful,1,2,9,3,"Oh, that's great."
Rachel Green,Scared,1,2,9,4,Why are- why are you so tanned?
Barry Farber,Scared,1,2,9,5,"Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba."
Rachel Green,Mad,1,2,9,6,Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
Barry Farber,Neutral,1,2,9,7,"No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt."
Robbie,Neutral,1,2,9,8,Me?!
Barry Farber,Scared,1,2,9,9,No! I went with Mindy.
Rachel Green,Mad,1,2,9,10,"Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!"
Barry Farber,Scared,1,2,9,11,"Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now."
Rachel Green,Mad,1,2,9,12,"Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!"
Barry Farber,Mad,1,2,9,13,Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
Rachel Green,Mad,1,2,9,14,And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Barry Farber,Peaceful,1,2,9,15,"Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you."
Rachel Green,Mad,1,2,9,16,Okay..
Barry Farber,Neutral,1,2,9,17,"See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist."
Rachel Green,Scared,1,2,9,18,Wow.
Barry Farber,Joyful,1,2,9,19,"You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit."
Rachel Green,Scared,1,2,9,20,What?
Robbie,Sad,1,2,9,21,Me.
Rachel Green,Sad,1,2,9,22,"Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me."
Barry Farber,Sad,1,2,9,23,"Well, thank you for giving it back."
Robbie,Scared,1,2,9,25,Hello?!
Susan Bunch,Mad,1,2,10,1,"Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?"
Ross Geller,Mad,1,2,10,2,Helen Geller? I don't think so.
Carol Willick,Powerful,1,2,10,3,Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
Ross Geller,Powerful,1,2,10,4,Thank you!
Carol Willick,Powerful,1,2,10,5,"No, I mean it's not Geller."
Ross Geller,Mad,1,2,10,6,"What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?"
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,2,10,7,"No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch."
Ross Geller,Mad,1,2,10,8,"Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?"
Susan Bunch,Powerful,1,2,10,9,It's my baby too.
Ross Geller,Mad,1,2,10,10,"Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm."
Susan Bunch,Mad,1,2,10,11,"Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!"
Carol Willick,Mad,1,2,10,12,"All right, you two, stop it!"
Ross Geller,Mad,1,2,10,13,"No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too."
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,2,10,14,Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.
Ross Geller,Powerful,1,2,10,15,"Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch."
Susan Bunch,Mad,1,2,10,16,"Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!"
Ross Geller,Mad,1,2,10,17,"My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-"
Dr. Oberman,Neutral,1,2,10,18,Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
#ALL#,Neutral,1,2,10,19,Yeah. Yeah. A little.
Dr. Oberman,Neutral,1,2,10,20,"Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. Uh, lie back.."
Ross Geller,Sad,1,2,10,21,"You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now."
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,2,10,23,Oh my God.
Susan Bunch,Joyful,1,2,10,24,Look at that.
Carol Willick,Joyful,1,2,10,25,I know.
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,2,11,1,Well? Isn't that amazing?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,2,11,2,What are we supposed to be seeing here?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,2,11,3,"I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,2,11,4,"You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato."
Ross Geller,Mad,1,2,11,5,"Then don't do that, alright?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,2,11,6,Okay!
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,2,11,7,Monica. Whaddya think?
Monica Geller,Sad,1,2,11,8,Mm-hmm.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,2,11,9,Wh- are you welling up?
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,2,11,10,No.
Ross Geller,Powerful,1,2,11,11,"You are, you're welling up."
Monica Geller,Mad,1,2,11,12,Am not!
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,2,11,13,You're gonna be an aunt.
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,2,11,14,Oh shut up!
Rachel Green,Mad,1,2,11,15,"Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,3,1,1,Hi guys!
#ALL#,Joyful,1,3,1,2,"Hey, Pheebs! Hi!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,3,1,3,"Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,1,3,1,4,"Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'"
#ALL#,Sad,1,3,1,5,Ohh. Ouch.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,3,1,6,"What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,3,1,7,"Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,3,1,8,Since when?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,3,1,9,"Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,3,1,10,Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,1,3,1,11,"Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,3,1,12,And everybody knows this?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,3,1,13,Yeah. Cushions the blow.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,3,1,14,"Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,3,1,15,"That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,3,1,16,"Uh, Ross."
Ross Geller,Scared,1,3,1,17,"What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,3,2,1,"""So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"""
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,1,3,2,2,"""Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."""
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,3,2,3,"Hey, that was really good!"
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,1,3,2,4,Thanks! Let's keep going.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,3,2,5,"Okay. ""So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"""
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,3,2,6,"""I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."""
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,3,2,7,"""Smoke away."""
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,3,2,9,I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,3,2,10,What?
Chandler Bing,Powerful,1,3,2,11,Relax your hand!
Chandler Bing,Powerful,1,3,2,13,Not so much!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,3,2,14,Whoah!
Chandler Bing,Powerful,1,3,2,15,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,1,3,2,16,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,3,2,17,"Alright, now try taking a puff."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,3,2,19,Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,3,2,20,"No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,1,3,2,21,"It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,1,3,2,23,"Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,3,2,24,Y'miss it?
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,3,2,25,"Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,3,6,1,Hi.. how was the game?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,3,6,2,Well..
#ALL#,Joyful,1,3,6,3,WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,3,6,4,Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,3,6,5,Alan.
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,3,6,6,"He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-..."
Rachel Green,Sad,1,3,6,7,"I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,3,6,8,"Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.."
Monica Geller,Scared,1,3,6,9,Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,3,6,10,What?
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,3,6,11,"..I dunno, a little too Alan?"
Rachel Green,Mad,1,3,6,12,"Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan."
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,3,6,13,"Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,3,6,14,I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,3,7,1,"Hey, Lizzie."
Lizzy,Neutral,1,3,7,2,"Hey, Weird Girl."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,3,7,3,I brought you alphabet soup.
Lizzy,Neutral,1,3,7,4,Did you pick out the vowels?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,3,7,5,"Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, ""sometimes y"". Uh, I also have something else for you."
Lizzy,Neutral,1,3,7,6,Saltines?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,3,7,7,"No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?"
Lizzy,Joyful,1,3,7,8,"What? Oh my God, there's really money in here."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,3,7,9,I know.
Lizzy,Neutral,1,3,7,10,"Weird Girl, what are you doing?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,3,7,11,"No, I want you to have it. I don't want it."
Lizzy,Neutral,1,3,7,12,"No, no, I ha-I have to give you something."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,3,7,13,"Oh, that's fine, no."
Lizzy,Joyful,1,3,7,14,Would you like my tin-foil hat?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,3,7,15,"No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks."
Lizzy,Neutral,1,3,7,16,"Please, let me do something."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,3,7,17,"Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?"
Lizzy,Neutral,1,3,7,18,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,3,7,19,Okay.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,3,9,1,A thumb?!
#ALL#,Scared,1,3,9,3,Eww!
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,1,3,9,4,"I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,3,9,5,"Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,3,9,6,"Does, um, anyone wanna see?"
#ALL#,Scared,1,3,9,7,Nooo!
#ALL#,Scared,1,3,9,9,"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!"
Rachel Green,Scared,1,3,9,10,It's worse than the thumb!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,3,9,11,"Hey, this is so unfair!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,3,9,12,"Oh, why is it unfair?"
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,3,9,13,"So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,1,3,9,15,...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,3,9,16,"Well, I-I could live without it."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,3,9,17,"Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,3,9,19,"Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,3,9,20,"Oh, ""you do, do you""?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,3,9,22,"You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,3,9,23,"""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,3,9,24,"Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered."
Rachel Green,Mad,1,3,9,25,"Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,3,10,1,Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
Paula,Neutral,1,3,10,2,No.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,1,3,10,3,"Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like."
Paula,Joyful,1,3,10,4,"Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!"
Monica Geller,Scared,1,3,10,5,"Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing."
Paula,Powerful,1,3,10,6,"Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!"
Monica Geller,Sad,1,3,10,7,I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
Paula,Powerful,1,3,10,8,"Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it."
Monica Geller,Sad,1,3,10,9,"No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,3,11,1,Do you have any respect for your body?
Ross Geller,Mad,1,3,11,2,Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,3,11,3,"Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,3,11,4,"Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,3,11,5,"Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,1,3,11,6,"God, he's good."
Ross Geller,Sad,1,3,11,7,If only he were a woman.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,3,11,8,Yeah.
Alan,Joyful,1,3,13,1,Wow.
Monica Geller,Sad,1,3,13,2,"I'm, I'm really sorry."
Alan,Peaceful,1,3,13,3,"Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,3,13,4,Relieved?
Alan,Mad,1,3,13,5,"Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,1,3,14,1,Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
Ross Geller,Powerful,1,3,14,2,Yeah. He could row like a viking.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,3,14,3,Hi.
#ALL#,Peaceful,1,3,14,4,Mmm.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,3,14,5,So how'd it go?
Monica Geller,Sad,1,3,14,6,"Oh, y'know.."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,3,14,7,Did he mention us?
Monica Geller,Sad,1,3,14,8,He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,1,3,14,9,"You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,1,3,14,10,...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
#ALL#,Mad,1,3,14,11,No no no!
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,3,14,12,"I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!"
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,1,3,14,13,If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,3,14,14,"Yeah, alright."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,4,1,1,Alright. Phoebe?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,4,1,2,"Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,4,1,3,"Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,4,1,4,"Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,4,1,5,"See, there's always one guy. ""If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."""
#ALL#,Joyful,1,4,1,6,"Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,4,1,7,"Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,4,1,8,Probably kill myself!
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,4,1,9,..Excuse me?
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,1,4,1,10,"Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,4,1,11,"Joey, uh- OMnipotent."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,1,4,1,12,"You are? Ross, I'm sorry.."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,4,3,1,...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,4,3,2,Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,4,3,3,We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,4,3,4,"Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- Sorry. Sorry."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,4,3,6,What?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,4,3,7,Peach pit.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,4,3,8,"Yes, Bunny?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,4,3,9,"Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,4,3,10,-Peaches?
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,4,3,11,"Actually, nectarines, but basically..."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,4,3,12,Could've been a peach.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,4,3,13,"Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- -the bus stop... I'm fine."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,4,3,14,"Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,4,4,1,"So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!"
Kiki,Joyful,1,4,4,2,"Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!"
Joanne,Neutral,1,4,4,3,Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,4,4,4,Okay.
Joanne,Neutral,1,4,4,5,When are you coming home?
Rachel Green,Mad,1,4,4,6,"What? Guys, I'm not."
Joanne,Neutral,1,4,4,7,"C'mon, this is us."
Rachel Green,Mad,1,4,4,8,I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
Kiki,Neutral,1,4,4,9,Waitressing?
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,4,4,10,"Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies."
Leslie,Neutral,1,4,4,11,Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,4,5,1,"Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,4,5,2,What's that?
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,4,5,3,"Weeeell, it's rum, and-"
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,4,5,4,Okay.
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,4,5,5,"We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister..."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,4,5,6,"Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,4,5,7,"Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people."
Rachel Green,Scared,1,4,5,8,"Oh, God, ask them what they want."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,4,5,9,"Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account."
Rachel Green,Scared,1,4,5,10,But I haven't used my card in weeks!
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,4,5,11,"That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay."
Rachel Green,Mad,1,4,5,12,"They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,4,5,13,"Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?"
Rachel Green,Sad,1,4,5,14,"Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,4,7,1,You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
Rachel Green,Sad,1,4,7,2,"Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,4,7,3,You are just like Jack.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,4,7,4,...Jack from downstairs?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,4,7,5,"No, Jack and the Beanstalk."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,4,7,6,"Ah, the other Jack."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,4,7,7,"Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village.."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,4,7,8,"Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,4,7,9,"Oh, see, Jack did love the cow."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,4,7,10,"But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like..."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,4,7,11,Floopy?
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,4,7,12,Yeah.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,4,7,13,"So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,4,7,14,"Oh, like that's a word."
Rachel Green,Scared,1,4,7,15,"Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,4,7,16,...Pheebs?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,4,7,17,"Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,4,7,18,"Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?"
Ross Geller,Mad,1,4,8,1,"Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,4,8,2,"See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks."
Ross Geller,Powerful,1,4,8,3,Pass it! Pass it!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,4,8,4,He's open!
#ALL#,Joyful,1,4,8,5,Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,4,8,7,"Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,4,9,1,'Scuse me.
Receptionist,Mad,1,4,9,2,"It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied."
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,4,9,3,"Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room."
Receptionist,Mad,1,4,9,4,"Hold on. Fill these out, sit over there."
Ross Geller,Mad,1,4,9,5,"Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented."
Receptionist,Mad,1,4,9,6,"Well, you'll have to wait your turn."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,4,9,7,"Well, how long do you think it'll be?"
Receptionist,Mad,1,4,9,8,Any minute now.
Ross Geller,Mad,1,4,9,9,"Hey, this- Heyy..."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,4,12,1,Light still out?
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,4,12,2,Yeah.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,4,12,3,Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,4,12,4,"Oh please, they're having sex."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,4,12,6,"So, whaddya think George is like?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,4,12,7,I think he's shy.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,4,12,8,Yeah?
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,4,12,9,Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,1,4,13,1,I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,4,13,2,"Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,4,13,3,"He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that."
Ross Geller,Scared,1,4,13,4,"Look, it's just a little more complicated..."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,4,13,5,"Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?"
Ross Geller,Mad,1,4,13,6,"Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you..."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,4,13,7,Then what?
Ross Geller,Scared,1,4,13,8,My first time with Carol was...
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,4,13,9,What?
Ross Geller,Sad,1,4,13,10,It was my first time.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,4,13,11,With Carol? Oh.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,4,13,12,"So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,4,13,13,"Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,4,14,1,"Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,4,14,2,Uh-huh.
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,4,14,3,"Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!"
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,1,4,14,4,"Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley."
Monica Geller,Mad,1,4,14,5,What?! You slept with Jason?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,4,14,6,You'd already broken up.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,4,14,7,How long?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,4,14,8,A couple hours.
Monica Geller,Mad,1,4,14,9,"Oh, that's nice!"
Rachel Green,Powerful,1,4,14,10,"Okay, okay, okay, I got one! Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me."
Monica Geller,Mad,1,4,14,11,Excuse me?!
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,4,14,12,Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? She was a big girl.
Monica Geller,Mad,1,4,14,13,"Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!"
Rachel Green,Mad,1,4,14,14,I was laughing! You made me laugh!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,4,14,15,There he is! There he is!
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,4,14,16,Where?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,4,14,17,Right- where we've been looking all night!
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,4,14,18,He is so cute!
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,4,14,19,"Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!"
#ALL#,Joyful,1,4,14,20,"Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the wowww."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,4,15,1,Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,4,15,2,"I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic..."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,4,15,3,Really?
Chandler Bing,Powerful,1,4,15,4,"No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.."
Both,Neutral,1,4,15,5,"Hey, buddy."
Ross Geller,Mad,1,4,15,6,Hi.
Receptionist,Joyful,1,4,15,7,"Oh, that's attractive."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,4,15,8,"Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight."
Ross Geller,Mad,1,4,15,9,"Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,4,15,10,"Oh, ah- the kid has it."
Ross Geller,Mad,1,4,15,11,"The kid...? Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck."
Kid,Powerful,1,4,15,12,"I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,1,4,15,13,"You gotta do it, man."
Ross Geller,Powerful,1,4,15,14,"Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever can't do it. Listen, uh- gimme back my puck."
Kid,Powerful,1,4,15,15,No.
Ross Geller,Mad,1,4,15,16,"'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!"
Kid,Mad,1,4,15,17,No! No!
Receptionist,Mad,1,4,15,18,Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
Ross Geller,Mad,1,4,15,19,GIVE ME MY PUCK!!
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,4,15,20,...Now that was fun.
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,4,16,1,"Okay, Monica: Right foot red."
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,4,16,2,"Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,4,16,4,Thanks.
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,4,16,5,"Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,4,16,7,"Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,4,16,8,"Oh, okay. Will you take my place?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,4,16,9,"Alright. Yes, this is Rachel."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,4,16,10,"Nooo! Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,4,16,11,Green. To the green.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,4,16,12,I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,4,16,13,"To the left, to the left- aww!"
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,4,16,14,Ohhh... I'm fine.
Monica Geller,Mad,1,5,1,1,Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
Ross Geller,Mad,1,5,1,2,"Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?"
Rachel Green,Mad,1,5,1,3,Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,1,5,1,4,"We can? All right, I'm tryin' that."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,5,1,5,"Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,1,5,1,6,"Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,5,1,8,Multiple orgasms!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,5,3,1,"Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you."
Monica Geller,Mad,1,5,3,2,Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,5,3,3,"Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is..."
Monica Geller,Scared,1,5,3,4,"Oh, god help us."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,5,3,5,What?
Monica Geller,Mad,1,5,3,6,Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,1,5,3,7,"Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,5,3,8,What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,1,5,3,9,"I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,5,4,1,"Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,5,4,2,"Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,5,4,3,It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,5,4,4,"It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,5,4,5,Nuh-uh.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,5,4,6,Yuh-huh.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,5,4,7,"So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,5,4,8,"Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,5,4,9,No.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,5,4,10,"Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,1,5,4,11,"Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,1,5,4,12,There you go.
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,5,5,1,Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,5,5,2,Yep.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,5,5,3,Which?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,5,5,4,Which what?
Monica Geller,Mad,1,5,5,5,"You've never met Bob, have you?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,5,5,6,"No, but he's..."
Monica Geller,Scared,1,5,5,7,"Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly..."
Angela Delveccio,Neutral,1,5,5,9,"Hey, Joey."
Monica Geller,Sad,1,5,5,10,...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,5,6,1,Where are they? Where are they?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,5,6,2,This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,5,6,3,It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,1,5,6,4,"Eww, I don't wanna do that."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,5,6,6,Here we go.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,5,6,7,"Ok, have a good break-up."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,5,6,8,"Hey, Janice."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Sad,1,5,6,9,"Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,5,6,10,"Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,Neutral,1,5,6,11,"We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping... ... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you..."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,5,6,13,What?
Janice Litman Goralnik,Neutral,1,5,6,14,What?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,5,6,15,What... did you get me there?
Janice Litman Goralnik,Neutral,1,5,6,16,I got you...these.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,5,6,17,Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
Janice Litman Goralnik,Neutral,1,5,6,18,"Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,5,6,19,That's great.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,5,6,21,"Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,Neutral,1,5,6,22,"No, no, I'm still working on mine."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,5,6,24,That's it?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,5,6,25,"Yeah, it was really hard."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,5,6,26,"Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,5,6,27,"Ok, you weren't there."
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,5,8,1,"He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?"
Angela Delveccio,Neutral,1,5,8,2,Brooklyn Heights.
Bob,Neutral,1,5,8,3,Cleveland.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,5,8,4,"How, how did that happen?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,5,8,5,Oh my god.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,5,8,6,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,5,8,7,I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,5,9,1,"So, you and Angela, huh?"
Bob,Joyful,1,5,9,2,Yep. Pretty much.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,5,9,3,"You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel."
Bob,Neutral,1,5,9,4,"Huh, I never really noticed."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,5,9,5,"Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it."
Bob,Joyful,1,5,9,6,"Monica, Monica is great."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,5,9,7,"Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually."
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,5,10,1,"I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific."
Angela Delveccio,Neutral,1,5,10,2,"Yeah, isn't he?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,5,10,3,"It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight."
Angela Delveccio,Joyful,1,5,10,4,You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,5,10,5,Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Angela Delveccio,Neutral,1,5,10,6,Huh. That's nice.
Rachel Green,Powerful,1,5,12,1,"Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do."
Ross Geller,Scared,1,5,12,2,"That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh."
Rachel Green,Scared,1,5,12,3,What uh-oh?
Ross Geller,Scared,1,5,12,4,"Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh."
Rachel Green,Scared,1,5,12,5,"Ross, what's the matter?"
Ross Geller,Mad,1,5,12,6,"Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done."
Rachel Green,Scared,1,5,12,7,"Come on, show me."
Ross Geller,Sad,1,5,12,8,"All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink."
Rachel Green,Sad,1,5,12,9,"Oh, everything's pink."
Ross Geller,Sad,1,5,12,10,"Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone."
Rachel Green,Sad,1,5,12,11,"Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!"
Monica Geller,Scared,1,5,13,1,"Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?"
Monica Geller,Scared,1,5,13,3,Oh my god.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,5,13,4,What?
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,5,13,5,Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,5,13,6,"Come on, they're close."
Monica Geller,Powerful,1,5,13,7,Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,1,5,13,8,"Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross."
Monica Geller,Sad,1,5,13,9,"Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,5,13,10,"Well, who's to say what's true? I mean..."
Monica Geller,Mad,1,5,13,11,"Oh my god, what were you thinking?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,5,13,12,"All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,5,13,13,Oh!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,5,13,14,Ow!
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,5,13,15,I'm outta here.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,5,13,16,"Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,5,13,17,Really?
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,1,5,13,18,"Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up."
Monica Geller,Scared,1,5,13,20,"I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,5,13,22,"Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,5,14,1,"Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Sad,1,5,14,2,Ow!
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,5,14,3,"Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,Mad,1,5,14,4,"Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,5,14,6,I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,5,14,7,Oh my god. How many of those have you had?
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,5,14,8,"Oh, I don't know, a million?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,5,14,9,"Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,5,14,10,I'm fine.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,5,14,11,All right.
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,5,14,13,I'm not fine. Here she comes.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,5,14,14,Wait here. Breathe.
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,5,14,16,How do you do that?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,5,14,17,It's like a gift.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,5,14,18,We should always always break up together.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,5,14,19,"Oh, I'd like that."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,5,15,1,You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,5,15,2,"Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now."
Rachel Green,Mad,1,5,15,4,"Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart."
Woman,Mad,1,5,15,5,"Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way."
Rachel Green,Mad,1,5,15,7,"I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart."
Woman,Mad,1,5,15,8,"Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it."
Rachel Green,Mad,1,5,15,9,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!"
Woman,Mad,1,5,15,10,Let go!
Rachel Green,Mad,1,5,15,12,"All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!"
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,5,15,14,Yes! Did you see that?
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,5,15,15,"You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,5,15,16,I could not have done this without you.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,1,5,15,18,"Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,5,15,19,Are you sure?
Ross Geller,Mad,1,5,15,20,No.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,5,16,1,"Oh, are you sure you're ok?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,5,16,2,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Scared,1,5,16,3,Does it still hurt?
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,5,16,4,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,5,16,5,What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,5,16,7,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,5,16,8,"Hey, how'd it go?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,5,16,9,Excellent.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,5,16,10,"We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves."
Ross Geller,Mad,1,5,16,11,"What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way."
Monica Geller,Sad,1,5,16,12,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,5,16,13,Where's Chandler?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,5,16,14,"Oh, he needed some time to grieve."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,5,16,16,I'm free! I'm free!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,5,16,17,That oughta do it.
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,6,1,1,"Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,6,1,2,"You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom..."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,6,1,3,"The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,1,6,1,5,"Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,6,1,7,"Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear."

Monica Geller,Neutral,1,6,5,1,"Alright, alright, alright..."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,6,5,3,Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,6,5,4,For what?

Monica Geller,Scared,1,6,5,6,"Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,6,5,7,Thank you!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,6,5,9,Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,6,5,10,He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,6,5,11,"C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,6,5,12,I warned you...
Rachel Green,Mad,1,6,5,14,Who is being loud?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,6,5,15,"Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,6,5,16,"Oh, you got the whole night, huh?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,6,5,17,"Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,6,5,18,"Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,6,5,19,"No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,6,5,20,"Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that."
Director,Powerful,1,6,6,1,"...Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,6,6,2,"Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity."
Director,Powerful,1,6,6,3,Lose the robe.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,6,6,4,Me?
Director,Powerful,1,6,6,5,That would work.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,6,6,6,Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost.
Director,Powerful,1,6,6,7,"Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action."
Director,Mad,1,6,6,9,"And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,6,6,10,"Well, I'm- I'm showering."
Director,Mad,1,6,6,11,"No, that was clenching."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,6,6,12,"Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here."
Director,Mad,1,6,6,13,"I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,6,6,14,I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,7,3,1,"Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!"
Monica Geller,Scared,1,7,3,2,"Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,7,3,3,"Wow, you guys, this is big."
Monica Geller,Mad,1,7,3,4,"Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,7,3,5,Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,7,3,7,"Well, I never call me."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,7,4,1,"Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre."
Jill Goodacre,Neutral,1,7,4,2,"Hi Mom, it's Jill."
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,7,4,3,"She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!"
Jill Goodacre,Neutral,1,7,4,4,"Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,7,4,5,Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
Jill Goodacre,Neutral,1,7,4,6,"I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,7,4,7,"Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,7,5,1,Hi everyone.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,7,5,2,"And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,7,5,3,"Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,1,7,5,4,"Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles."
Rachel Green,Sad,1,7,5,6,That had to hurt!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,7,6,1,"Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,7,6,3,There you go!
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,7,6,5,You're definitely scaring here.
Jill Goodacre,Joyful,1,7,6,6,Would you like to call somebody?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,7,6,7,"Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,7,7,1,Hello?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,7,7,2,"Hey, it's me."
Monica Geller,Scared,1,7,7,3,It's Chandler! Are you OK?
Chandler Bing,Sad,1,7,7,4,"Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr."
Monica Geller,Scared,1,7,7,5,What?
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,7,7,6,I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
Monica Geller,Scared,1,7,7,7,I have no idea what you just said.
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,7,7,8,Put Joey on the phone.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,7,7,9,What's up man?
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,7,7,10,I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,7,7,11,"Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,1,7,7,12,"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,7,11,1,Hmmm... this is so nice.
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,7,11,2,"OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,7,11,3,OK.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,7,11,4,"OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,7,11,5,Ohhh!!!!
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,7,11,6,"Yes, yes, that's right..."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,1,7,11,7,"Oh, look at the little cat!"
Ross Geller,Scared,1,7,11,8,What? Ow!
Monica Geller,Peaceful,1,7,12,1,This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,7,12,3,"Sorry, that was wax."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,7,12,4,"Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,7,12,5,Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
Rachel Green,Scared,1,7,12,6,During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,7,12,7,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,7,14,1,"Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?"
Rachel Green,Powerful,1,7,14,2,Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
Mr. Heckles,Mad,1,7,14,3,"Er, yeah, it's mine."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,1,7,14,4,He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
Mr. Heckles,Mad,1,7,14,5,"Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,1,7,14,6,Wait a minute. What's his name?
Mr. Heckles,Scared,1,7,14,7,Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
Rachel Green,Powerful,1,7,14,8,Bob Buttons?
Mr. Heckles,Peaceful,1,7,14,9,"Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,1,7,14,10,Oooh! You are a very bad man!
Mr. Heckles,Mad,1,7,14,11,You owe me a cat.
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,7,16,1,Lucky sixes....

Paolo,Joyful,1,7,16,10,Monopoly!
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,7,16,11,Look at that!
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,7,16,12,"So, um... where did Paolo come from?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,7,16,13,"Oh... Italy, I think."
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,7,16,14,"No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives."
Rachel Green,Sad,1,7,16,15,"Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,7,16,16,"That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,1,7,16,18,Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,7,16,19,"Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,7,16,20,Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,7,16,21,"Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,7,16,23,You betcha!
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,1,7,17,1,"Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,7,17,3,"Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth."
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,7,17,4,"Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking."
Jill Goodacre,Scared,1,7,17,6,Are you alright?
Jill Goodacre,Powerful,1,7,17,8,"My God, you're choking! That better?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,7,17,9,Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
Jill Goodacre,Neutral,1,7,17,10,Perfection?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,7,20,1,"Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48...."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,7,20,2,Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,7,20,3,Thanks.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,7,20,4,Kinda... spooky without any lights.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,7,20,5,Bwah-hah-hah!
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,7,20,7,"OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah..."
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,7,20,9,Oh.. oh... oh.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,7,20,10,"Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,8,1,1,Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Shelley,Joyful,1,8,1,2,"Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you."
Chandler Bing,Sad,1,8,1,3,"Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'..."
Shelley,Powerful,1,8,1,4,Do you want a date Saturday?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,8,1,5,Yes please.
Shelley,Peaceful,1,8,1,6,"Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-"
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,8,1,7,He's a he?
Shelley,Scared,1,8,1,8,"Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye..."
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,8,2,1,"...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,8,2,2,"Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be..."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,8,2,3,You did?
Rachel Green,Mad,1,8,2,4,"Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,8,2,5,"Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,8,2,6,I did.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,8,2,7,"Yeah, I think so, yeah."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,8,2,8,Not me.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,8,2,9,"Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,8,2,10,You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,8,2,11,"No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so..."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,8,2,13,"Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,1,8,2,14,"I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny..."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,8,2,15,"Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?"
#ALL#,Neutral,1,8,2,16,Yeah! Right!
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,8,2,17,WHAT IS IT?!
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,8,2,18,"Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality."
#ALL#,Peaceful,1,8,2,19,Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,8,2,20,"Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,8,2,22,"Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,8,2,23,"Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,8,2,24,So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,8,2,25,"Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,8,2,26,"Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,8,4,1,"I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?"
Rachel Green,Mad,1,8,4,2,"Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,8,4,3,"Yeah, you have homosexual hair."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,8,4,5,"So, um, did she..."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,8,4,6,Twice.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,8,4,7,Twice?
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,1,8,4,8,"Oh, that sucks!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,8,4,9,You guys okay?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,8,4,10,"I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh..."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,8,4,11,Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,8,4,12,"Nono, she's gone."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,8,4,13,We checked. A lot.
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,1,8,4,14,"Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,1,8,4,15,"Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,8,4,16,Thanks!
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,8,4,17,Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,8,4,18,"Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,8,4,19,"Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,8,5,1,I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
Judy Geller,Joyful,1,8,5,2,"Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!"
Judy Geller,Neutral,1,8,5,4,"Sweetie, you think you can get in there?"
Ross Geller,Mad,1,8,5,5,I don't see why not.
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,8,5,7,Here's my retainer!
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,8,6,1,I was just thinking. When my time comes-
Monica Geller,Scared,1,8,6,2,Dad!
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,8,6,3,"Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea."
Monica Geller,Scared,1,8,6,4,You what?
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,8,6,5,"I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,8,6,6,Define fun.
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,8,6,7,"C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch..."
Monica Geller,Scared,1,8,6,8,"...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun."
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,8,6,9,"Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,8,6,10,That's probably what they'll say.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,8,6,11,I'd like that.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,8,7,1,"Hey, gorgeous."
Shelley,Neutral,1,8,7,2,"Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,8,7,3,"No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake."
Shelley,Joyful,1,8,7,4,Oh! Okay! Phew!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,8,7,5,"So, uh... what do you think it is about me?"
Shelley,Neutral,1,8,7,6,"I dunno, uh... you just have a-a..."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,8,7,7,"...Quality, right, great."
Shelley,Neutral,1,8,7,8,"Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,8,7,9,"Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?"
Shelley,Joyful,1,8,7,10,What? He's cute!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,8,7,11,"Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll."
Shelley,Neutral,1,8,7,12,Is Brian...?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,8,7,13,"No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him."
Shelley,Neutral,1,8,7,14,"Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,8,7,15,Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,8,8,1,This one?
Aunt Lillian,Neutral,1,8,8,2,No.
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,8,8,3,"I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy."
Aunt Lillian,Joyful,1,8,8,4,"You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one."
Judy Geller,Neutral,1,8,8,5,You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
Ross Geller,Powerful,1,8,8,6,Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.
Aunt Lillian,Powerful,1,8,8,7,Wait! We need shoes!
Ross Geller,Scared,1,8,8,9,"Okay. Um, how about these?"
Judy Geller,Neutral,1,8,8,10,That's really a day shoe.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,8,8,11,And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
Aunt Lillian,Neutral,1,8,8,12,Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,8,8,13,"Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work."
Aunt Lillian,Joyful,1,8,8,14,"No, it really should be burgundy."
Judy Geller,Neutral,1,8,8,15,Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,8,8,16,"No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back."
Ross Geller,Mad,1,8,8,18,Oh my God..
Judy Geller,Scared,1,8,8,19,"Is everything all right, dear?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,8,8,20,"Yeah, just... just Nana stuff."
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,8,9,1,"How we doing, you guys ready?"
Monica Geller,Mad,1,8,9,2,Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,8,9,3,Some days it's all I can think about.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,8,9,4,"Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings."
Rachel Green,Scared,1,8,9,5,"Oh, you-you mean your earrings?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,8,9,6,What'd I say?
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,8,9,7,Hm-m.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,8,9,8,Are these the shoes?
Rachel Green,Powerful,1,8,9,9,Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
Ross Geller,Powerful,1,8,9,10,"What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?"
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,1,8,9,11,Morning. We ready to go?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,8,9,12,"Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,8,10,1,It was a really beautiful service.
Judy Geller,Neutral,1,8,10,2,"It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,8,10,4,What?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,8,10,5,"Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,8,10,6,"Check it out, Giants-Cowboys."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,8,10,7,You're watching a football game at a funeral?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,8,10,8,"No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception."
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,8,10,9,"You are a frightening, frightening man."
Rachel Green,Mad,1,8,10,11,Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,8,10,12,"Oh, I hope they're not ruined."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,8,10,13,"God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!"
Ross Geller,Sad,1,8,10,14,"I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-"
#ALL#,Mad,1,8,10,15,God! Ross!
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,8,10,16,I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
Rachel Green,Scared,1,8,12,1,"Hey, who's this little naked guy?"
Ross Geller,Mad,1,8,12,2,That little naked guy would be me.
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,8,12,3,"Aww, look at the little thing."
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,8,12,4,"Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?"
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,8,12,5,Who are those people?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,8,12,6,Got me.
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,8,12,7,"Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'."
Rachel Green,Scared,1,8,12,8,"Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,8,12,9,"Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,8,12,10,Looks like a fun gang.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,8,12,11,"Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!"
Ross Geller,Mad,1,8,12,12,"Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,8,13,1,"Hey, Lowell."
Lowell,Neutral,1,8,13,2,"Hey, Chandler."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,8,13,3,So how's it going there in Financial Services?
Lowell,Neutral,1,8,13,4,It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,8,13,5,"Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not."
Lowell,Neutral,1,8,13,6,I know. That's what I told her.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,8,13,7,Really.
Lowell,Neutral,1,8,13,8,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,8,13,9,So- you can tell?
Lowell,Neutral,1,8,13,10,"Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,8,13,11,"So you don't think I have a, a quality?"
Lowell,Neutral,1,8,13,12,"Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,8,13,13,He is?
Lowell,Neutral,1,8,13,14,"Yup, and waaay out of your league."
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,8,13,15,"Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,1,9,1,1,"Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?"
Terry,Neutral,1,9,1,2,An advance?
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,9,1,3,"It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job."
Terry,Mad,1,9,1,4,"Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful."
Rachel Green,Powerful,1,9,1,5,"Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,9,3,1,"Hi, is uh, is Carol here?"
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,9,3,2,"No, she's at a faculty meeting."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,9,3,3,"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,9,3,4,"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum."
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,9,3,5,What's it look like?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,9,3,6,Kinda like a big face without skin.
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,9,3,7,"Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,9,3,8,"Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian."
Susan Bunch,Joyful,1,9,3,9,"Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it."
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,9,3,10,"Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic."
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,9,3,11,"Actually, I'm reading it to the baby."
Ross Geller,Scared,1,9,3,12,"The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?"
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,9,3,13,"What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?"
Ross Geller,Scared,1,9,3,14,"You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?"
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,9,3,15,"Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,9,3,16,"Do you uh, do you talk about me?"
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,9,3,17,"Yeah, yeah, all the time."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,9,3,18,Really?
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,9,3,19,"But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,9,4,1,"Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,9,4,2,"Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,9,4,3,"I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,9,4,5,"Hey, Rach, did you make your money?"
Rachel Green,Sad,1,9,4,6,"No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,9,4,7,"Rach, here's your mail."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,9,4,8,"Thanks, you can just put it on the table."
Monica Geller,Powerful,1,9,4,9,"No, here's your mail."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,9,4,10,"Thanks, you can just put it on the table."
Monica Geller,Powerful,1,9,4,11,Would you just open it?
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,9,4,13,"Oh my god, oh, you guys are great."
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,9,4,14,We all chipped in.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,9,4,15,We did?
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,9,4,16,You owe me 20 bucks.
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,9,4,17,Thank you. Thank you so much!
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,9,4,18,"Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,9,4,19,"Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,9,4,20,"All right, I'm nine years old."
Ross Geller,Mad,1,9,4,21,"Oh, I hate this story."
Chandler Bing,Sad,1,9,4,22,"We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced."
Rachel Green,Sad,1,9,4,23,Oh my god.
Chandler Bing,Sad,1,9,4,24,Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,9,5,1,"Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together."
Girl,Scared,1,9,5,2,We did?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,9,5,3,"Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis?"
Girl,Peaceful,1,9,5,4,"Yeah, right."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,9,5,5,I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
Girl,Mad,1,9,5,6,Get out.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,9,5,7,"I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back."
Girl,Powerful,1,9,5,8,Really? You don't know what that means to me.
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,1,9,5,9,"Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?"
Girl,Joyful,1,9,5,10,Nothing.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,9,5,11,"Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?"
Girl,Neutral,1,9,5,12,Yeah. Oh.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,9,5,13,What's wrong?
Girl,Scared,1,9,5,14,"I just remembered, I have to do something."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,9,5,15,Oh. What?
Girl,Mad,1,9,5,16,"Um, leave."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,9,5,17,"Wait, wait, wait!"
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,9,9,1,Anytime you're ready.
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,9,9,2,"Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but..."
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,9,9,3,Just aim for the bump.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,9,9,4,"Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid."
Carol Willick,Powerful,1,9,9,5,"So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,9,9,6,"Hello, baby. Hello, hello."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,9,10,1,I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,1,9,10,2,"Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,9,10,3,"Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,9,10,4,We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,9,10,5,No I don't.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,9,10,6,"Yes, you do. When we left, you said, ""got the keys."""
Monica Geller,Mad,1,9,10,7,"No I didn't. I asked, ""got the ke-eys?"""
Rachel Green,Mad,1,9,10,8,"No, no, no, you said, ""got the keys""."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,9,10,9,Do either of you have the keys?
Monica Geller,Scared,1,9,10,10,The oven is on.
Rachel Green,Scared,1,9,10,11,"Oh, I gotta get my ticket!"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,9,10,12,"Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key."
Monica Geller,Mad,1,9,10,13,"Well then get it, get it!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,9,10,14,That tone will not make me go any faster.
Monica Geller,Mad,1,9,10,15,Joey!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,9,10,16,That one will.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,9,11,1,"And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore."
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,9,11,2,"Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,9,11,3,"Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?"
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,9,11,5,"Hi, how's it goin?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,9,11,6,"Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that?"
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,9,11,7,I did.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,9,11,8,"Does it always, uh--?"
Carol Willick,Joyful,1,9,11,9,"No, no that was the first."
Susan Bunch,Joyful,1,9,11,10,Keep singing! Keep singing!
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,9,11,11,"Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo."
Susan Bunch,Joyful,1,9,11,12,I felt it!
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,9,11,13,"Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,10,1,1,Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
#ALL#,Joyful,1,10,1,3,Oooh!
Monica Geller,Scared,1,10,1,4,W-wait. What is that?
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,10,1,5,'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
Monica Geller,Scared,1,10,1,6,"No, no, I don't."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,10,1,7,"Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,10,1,8,My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,10,1,9,That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,10,1,10,"Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,10,1,11,"Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,10,1,12,"Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so..."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,10,1,13,Why don't you just get a roommate?
Ross Geller,Sad,1,10,1,14,"Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'."
David,Powerful,1,10,4,1,"...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,10,4,2,"Okay, alright, I have a question, then."
David,Neutral,1,10,4,3,Yuh.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,10,4,4,"Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?"
David,Joyful,1,10,4,5,"Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,10,4,6,Sure.
David,Scared,1,10,4,7,"Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,10,4,8,"Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body."
David,Neutral,1,10,4,9,Rrrreally.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,10,4,10,"Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me."
David,Scared,1,10,4,11,...Now? Now?
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,1,10,4,12,"Oh yeah, right now."
David,Neutral,1,10,4,13,"Okay, okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. And I'll take- this was a gift."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,10,4,14,"Okay, now you're just kinda tidying."
David,Joyful,1,10,4,15,"Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,10,4,16,I can hop.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,10,6,1,Hello?
David,Joyful,1,10,6,2,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,10,6,3,Hi.
David,Joyful,1,10,6,4,Hi! What-what're you doing here?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,10,6,5,"Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting!"
Max,Sad,1,10,6,6,It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,10,6,7,"Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?"
Max,Mad,1,10,6,8,"Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!'"
David,Peaceful,1,10,6,9,"Thank you, Max. Thank you."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,10,6,10,So-so you're really not going?
David,Neutral,1,10,6,11,I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,10,6,12,Oh don't do that.
David,Neutral,1,10,6,13,Please.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,10,6,14,Oh no no.
David,Neutral,1,10,6,15,"No, but I'm asking-"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,10,6,16,"Oh, but I can't do that-"
David,Scared,1,10,6,17,"No, but I can't-"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,10,6,18,"It's your thing, and-"
David,Neutral,1,10,6,19,-make the decision-
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,10,6,20,"Okay, um, stay."
David,Neutral,1,10,6,21,Stay.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,10,6,22,Stay.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,10,6,24,Getting so good at that!
David,Peaceful,1,10,6,25,It was Max's stuff.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,11,1,1,Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,11,1,2,Why?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,1,11,1,3,"Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right."
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,11,1,4,"Oh my God. Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,11,1,5,"Where? Ooh, come to Momma."
Monica Geller,Scared,1,11,1,6,"He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool."
Guy,Neutral,1,11,1,8,Nice hat.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,11,1,11,We should do something. Whistle.
Monica Geller,Mad,1,11,1,12,We are not going to whistle.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,11,1,13,"Come on, do it."
Monica Geller,Mad,1,11,1,14,No!
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,1,11,1,15,Do it!
Monica Geller,Mad,1,11,1,16,No!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,11,1,17,Do it do it do it!
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,11,1,18,Woo-woo!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,11,1,20,I can't believe you did that!
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,11,2,1,"Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?"
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,1,11,2,2,"I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,11,2,3,"Phoebe, what are you doing?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,11,2,4,Maybe nobody's tried this.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,11,2,5,"I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,11,2,6,"Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,11,2,7,"Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,11,2,8,"Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,11,2,9,I wish all guys could be like him.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,11,2,10,I know.
Monica Geller,Mad,1,11,4,1,"Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,11,4,3,What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
Monica Geller,Mad,1,11,4,4,Nah... not-not special enough.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,11,4,5,Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,11,4,6,Waaay too special.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,11,7,1,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,11,7,2,Hi.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,11,7,3,What are you doing here?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,11,7,4,"Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,11,7,5,I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,11,7,6,"No. No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,11,7,7,How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,1,11,7,8,"Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!"
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,11,8,1,Oh my God.
Ross Geller,Powerful,1,11,8,2,You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,11,8,3,I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
Ross Geller,Scared,1,11,8,4,"Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom."
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,11,8,5,What?
Ross Geller,Scared,1,11,8,6,"I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-"
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,11,8,7,You knew about this?
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,1,11,8,8,"Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing."
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,11,8,9,"I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,11,8,10,"Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened."
Ross Geller,Mad,1,11,8,11,"Thanks, man, big help."
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,11,8,12,I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
Ross Geller,Scared,1,11,8,13,"I wasn't- I mean, I-"
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,11,8,14,"Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you."
Ross Geller,Sad,1,11,8,15,I know-
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,11,8,16,I can't believe you did this.
Ross Geller,Sad,1,11,8,17,Chandler-
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,11,8,18,"Me neither, y'know what-"
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,11,8,19,I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,1,11,8,20,What are you mad at me for?!
Ross Geller,Sad,1,11,8,21,Chandler-
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,11,8,22,You gotta let me slam the door!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,11,8,23,"Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?"
Ross Geller,Sad,1,11,8,24,Joey-
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,11,8,25,Ah! Huh?
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,11,12,1,"Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,11,12,2,What's a 'niffle'?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,11,12,3,You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Rachel Green,Sad,1,11,12,4,"Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist..."
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,11,12,5,"Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!"
Rachel Green,Mad,1,11,12,6,"Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!"
#ALL#,Sad,1,11,12,7,Nooo!
Monica Geller,Mad,1,12,2,1,"Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,12,2,3,"Ross, did you really read all these baby books?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,12,2,4,"Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,12,2,5,"Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,12,2,6,"And, we're done with the yogurt."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,1,12,2,7,Sorry.
Monica Geller,Mad,1,12,2,8,"Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,12,2,10,"Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,12,2,11,Hello!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,12,2,12,How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,12,2,14,"Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos"
Paolo,Joyful,1,12,2,15,"Ah, poke a nose, mmm"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,12,2,18,"So, did I hear Poconos?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,12,2,19,"Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,12,2,20,"Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,12,2,21,"Yeah, that's a big step."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,12,2,22,I know...
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,12,2,24,"Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!"
Ross Geller,Mad,1,12,2,25,"Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,12,2,27,"I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally..."
Ross Geller,Mad,1,12,2,29,"...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!"
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,12,5,1,"Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?"
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,1,12,5,2,That's the rule.
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,12,5,3,"What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,12,5,4,How'd you get to that?
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,12,5,5,"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,12,5,6,You knew about that?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,12,5,7,"Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,12,5,8,"Ok, ok, How about if we split it?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,12,5,9,"What do you mean, like, buy it together?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,12,5,10,Yeah
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,12,5,11,You think we're ready for something like that?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,12,5,12,Why not?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,12,5,13,"Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,12,5,14,"Why, are you moving out?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,12,5,15,I'm not moving out.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,12,5,16,You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Chandler Bing,Sad,1,12,5,17,"Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip..."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,1,12,5,18,"Aw, I know all about Kip!"
Chandler Bing,Sad,1,12,5,19,"It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,12,5,20,"Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?"
Chandler Bing,Sad,1,12,5,21,"Aw, don't do that"
Phoebe's Assistant,Neutral,1,12,6,1,We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,12,6,2,"Ok, thanks."
Phoebe's Assistant,Neutral,1,12,6,3,"Oh, here comes your 3:00. I don't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum"
Paolo,Neutral,1,12,6,4,"Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,12,6,5,"Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?"
Paolo,Neutral,1,12,6,6,"Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,12,6,7,"Well, Racquela's right, yeah!"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,12,6,9,"Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started."
Paolo,Scared,1,12,6,10,"Uh, I am, uh, being naked?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,12,6,11,"Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!"
Rachel Green,Powerful,1,12,7,1,"I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows...."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,12,7,2,And Monica knows...
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,12,7,3,"Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,12,7,4,"Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,12,7,5,So what's it gonna be?
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,12,7,6,"Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,12,7,7,"I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,12,7,8,Or an uncle...
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,12,7,11,Hi Pheebs!
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,12,7,12,Pheebs!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,12,7,13,Fine!
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,12,7,14,"Phoebe, what's the matter?"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,1,12,7,15,"Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts."
Customer,Neutral,1,12,7,16,"Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,12,7,17,"Oh, right, that's me!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,12,7,18,"Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,12,7,19,Fine.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,12,7,20,"Phoebe, what is it?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,12,7,21,"All right, you know Paolo?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,12,7,22,"I'm familiar with his work, yes..."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,12,7,23,"Well, he made a move on me."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,12,7,25,"Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,12,7,26,"More coffee over here, please!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,12,8,1,"Well, what happened?"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,12,8,2,"Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until."
Ross Geller,Scared,1,12,8,5,My God.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,12,8,6,Are you sure?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,12,8,9,"Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore."
Monica Geller,Mad,1,12,8,10,Was it...?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,1,12,8,11,"Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there."
Guys,Joyful,1,12,8,12,Oooooo....
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,12,8,14,"""Ooo,"" what?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,12,8,15,Uma Thurman.
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,12,8,16,Oh!
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,12,8,17,The actress!
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,12,8,19,Thanks Rach.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,12,8,21,So what are you gonna do?
Ross Geller,Powerful,1,12,8,22,"You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,12,8,23,"Oh, yeah, you have to tell her."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,1,12,8,24,Feminist issue. That's where I went!
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,12,8,25,She is gonna hate me.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,12,8,26,"Yeah, well..."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,12,9,1,"Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,12,9,2,That's patio furniture!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,12,9,3,"So what, like people are gonna come in and think, ""Uh-oh, I'm outside again?"" Of course!"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,1,12,9,4,What about the birds?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,12,9,5,"I don't know, birds just don't say, ""Hello, sit here, eat something."""
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,12,9,6,You pick one.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,1,12,9,7,"All right, how about the ladybugs?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,12,9,8,"Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,12,9,9,"Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!"
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,12,9,10,"Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,12,10,1,Hey!
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,12,10,2,Hi Pheebs!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,12,10,3,Are you moving out?
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,12,10,4,"No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,12,10,5,"Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,12,10,6,"Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,12,10,7,"Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,"
Rachel Green,Sad,1,12,10,8,"Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs..."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,1,12,10,9,"Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,12,10,10,"Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,12,10,11,"Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies"
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,12,10,12,"All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,12,10,13,Which proves that I never lie.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,12,10,14,I guess you don't.
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,1,12,10,15,Paolo made a pass at me.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,12,11,1,"So, what do you think?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,12,11,2,I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,12,11,3,I know!
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,12,11,5,"So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,12,11,6,"Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,12,11,7,Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,12,12,1,Are you okay?
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,12,12,2,I need some milk.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,12,12,3,"Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?"
Rachel Green,Sad,1,12,12,4,"No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all ""Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..."" Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,1,12,12,5,"I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!"
Rachel Green,Sad,1,12,12,7,"Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,12,12,9,"No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?"
Rachel Green,Mad,1,12,12,10,"I don't know...right, he's the pig!"
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,1,12,12,11,Such a pig!
Rachel Green,Mad,1,12,12,12,"Oh, God, he's such a pig,"
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,1,12,12,13,Oh he's like a...
Rachel Green,Mad,1,12,12,14,He's like a big disgusting...
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,1,12,12,15,...like a...
Rachel Green,Mad,1,12,12,16,...pig...pig man!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,12,12,17,"Yes, good! Ok..."
Rachel Green,Sad,1,12,12,18,"Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,12,12,19,"Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you..."
Rachel Green,Sad,1,12,12,20,"Ok, Ok, Pheebs..."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,12,12,21,The end.
Rachel Green,Sad,1,12,12,22,"Oh, God..."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,12,12,23,Should I not have told you?
Rachel Green,Sad,1,12,12,24,"No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better..."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,12,13,1,"I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so..."
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,12,13,2,We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,12,13,3,"Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,1,12,13,4,"No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,12,13,5,"Come on, two on one."
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,12,13,6,"What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!"
Ross Geller,Scared,1,12,13,7,"What, now?"
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,1,12,13,8,"Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!"
Chandler Bing,Powerful,1,12,13,9,"My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,12,15,1,Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,12,15,3,"Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,12,15,4,"Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!"
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,12,15,5,"Yeah, get out!"
Monica Geller,Powerful,1,12,15,6,"You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,12,15,7,One more game?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,12,15,8,Oh yeah!
Rachel Green,Mad,1,13,1,1,"That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock"
Chandler Bing,Sad,1,13,1,2,I'm sorry!
Rachel Green,Mad,1,13,1,3,You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,13,1,4,"Rachel, wait, wait."
Rachel Green,Mad,1,13,1,5,"No, you wait! This is ridiculous!"
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,13,1,6,Can I just say one thing?
Rachel Green,Mad,1,13,1,7,What? What?!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,13,1,8,That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
Rachel Green,Mad,1,13,1,9,Oh!!
Joey Tribbiani Sr.,Sad,1,13,3,1,"Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,13,3,2,"Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?"
Joey Tribbiani Sr.,Neutral,1,13,3,4,Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,13,3,5,Sure. So how long you been...
Joey Tribbiani Sr.,Neutral,1,13,3,6,"Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,13,3,7,Since then?!
Joey Tribbiani Sr.,Neutral,1,13,3,8,"No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,13,3,9,...I d'know.
Joey Tribbiani Sr.,Neutral,1,13,3,10,Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,13,3,11,You're one to talk.
Joey Tribbiani Sr.,Scared,1,13,3,12,"Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,13,3,13,Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
Joey Tribbiani Sr.,Mad,1,13,3,14,"Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,13,5,1,"Night, you guys."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,13,5,3,"Oh look, it's the woman we ordered."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,13,5,4,"Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?"
Ronni Rapalono,Neutral,1,13,5,5,"Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,1,13,5,6,I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Ronni Rapalono,Joyful,1,13,5,7,"Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,13,5,8,"Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,13,7,1,"Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,13,7,2,Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,13,7,3,"Well, you're gonna."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,13,7,4,"I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls..."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,13,7,5,"Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,13,7,6,"Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking..."
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,13,7,7,"Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,13,7,8,No.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,1,13,7,9,"No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I'm married."""
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,13,7,10,You really think so?
Chandler Bing,Powerful,1,13,7,11,Yeah. I really do.
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,1,13,7,12,"Thanks, Chandler."
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,13,7,13,Get off!
Ronni Rapalono,Neutral,1,13,8,1,Hi.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,13,8,2,Hi...May I help you?
Ronni Rapalono,Scared,1,13,8,3,"Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?"
Monica Geller,Scared,1,13,8,4,Okay...who are you?
Ronni Rapalono,Scared,1,13,8,5,"Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,13,8,6,"Oh, c'mon in."
Ronni Rapalono,Joyful,1,13,8,7,Thanks.
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,13,8,8,"Hi, I'm Rachel."
Ronni Rapalono,Neutral,1,13,8,9,Hi.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,13,8,10,Bathroom's up there.
Ronni Rapalono,Joyful,1,13,8,11,Great.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,13,8,12,"Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?"
Ronni Rapalono,Neutral,1,13,8,13,"Oh, like, uh, five minutes?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,13,8,14,"Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib."
Joey Tribbiani Sr.,Joyful,1,13,8,15,"Hey. Morning, dear."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,13,8,17,Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,13,8,19,What's the matter with you?!
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,13,8,20,I thought it was Chandler!
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,13,8,21,What? What?
Rachel Green,Mad,1,13,8,22,You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,13,8,23,"Sorry, my my thing was in there with me."
#ALL#,Neutral,1,13,9,1,"Hey, Pheebs."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,13,9,2,Hey.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,13,9,3,How's it going?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,13,9,4,Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,13,9,6,So what's going on?
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,13,9,7,"Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,13,9,8,"I dunno, there's just something about..."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,13,9,9,Basically we just feel that he's...
Rachel Green,Mad,1,13,9,10,We hate that guy.
#ALL#,Mad,1,13,9,11,Yeah. Hate him.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,13,9,12,"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,13,9,13,"Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?"
#ALL#,Mad,1,13,9,14,"...No, we hate him."
Rachel Green,Sad,1,13,9,15,We're sorry.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,13,10,1,Ma! What're you doing here?
Gloria Tribbiani,Mad,1,13,10,2,I came to give you this and this.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,13,10,3,Oww! Big ring!
Gloria Tribbiani,Mad,1,13,10,4,"Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,13,10,5,"Hold on, you-you knew?"
Gloria Tribbiani,Mad,1,13,10,6,"Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. ""I'm sleeping over at my accountant's,"" I mean, what is that? Please!"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,13,10,7,"So then how could you I mean, how could you?!"
Gloria Tribbiani,Mad,1,13,10,8,"Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,13,10,9,"Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?"
Gloria Tribbiani,Peaceful,1,13,10,10,"Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,13,10,11,I'm...happy...for you?
Gloria Tribbiani,Mad,1,13,10,12,"Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,1,13,10,13,"Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want."
Gloria Tribbiani,Neutral,1,13,10,14,"I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,13,10,15,Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
Gloria Tribbiani,Joyful,1,13,10,16,That's sweet. Could I take her?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,13,10,17,With this ring? No contest.
Roger,Scared,1,13,11,1,"What's wrong, sweetie?"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,1,13,11,2,"Nothing, nothing."
Roger,Neutral,1,13,11,3,"Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,13,11,4,"It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't."
Roger,Neutral,1,13,11,5,Oh. They don't.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,13,11,6,But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
Roger,Neutral,1,13,11,7,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,13,11,8,Intense and creepy.
Roger,Sad,1,13,11,9,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,13,11,10,"But I don't. Me, Phoebe."
Roger,Neutral,1,13,11,11,"Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,13,11,12,"You're not? See, that's why you're so great!"
Roger,Powerful,1,13,11,13,"Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,13,12,1,"So you talked to your dad, huh."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,13,12,2,"Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,13,12,3,Wow.
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,13,12,4,Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,1,13,12,5,"So Joey, you okay?"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,1,13,12,6,"Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes."
Rachel Green,Sad,1,13,12,7,"Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them."
Chandler Bing,Sad,1,13,12,8,"If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,13,12,9,Hey.
#ALL#,Neutral,1,13,12,10,"Hey, Pheebs."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,13,12,11,How's it going?
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,1,13,12,12,"Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger."
#ALL#,Peaceful,1,13,12,13,Awww.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,13,12,14,"Yeah, right."
#ALL#,Sad,1,13,12,15,Aaawwwwww!!
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,13,12,16,What happened?
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,1,13,12,17,"I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,13,13,1,"Hey, Joey. What's going on?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,13,13,2,Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
Monica Geller,Mad,1,13,13,3,Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,13,13,4,Sorry. Wrong boobies.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,13,13,6,"Hello, Joey."
Joey Tribbiani Sr.,Scared,1,13,13,8,"Oh! ...Hello, dear."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,14,1,1,"I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,14,1,2,She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,14,1,3,Any contact?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,14,1,4,She lent me an egg once.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,14,1,5,You're in!
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,14,1,6,"Aw, right."
Woman,Neutral,1,14,1,7,"Hi, Ross."
Ross Geller,Scared,1,14,1,8,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,14,1,9,"Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third..."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,14,1,10,"Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,14,1,11,An egg?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,14,1,12,"Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, ""Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."""
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,14,1,13,I think it's winning.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,14,1,14,I think it's insane.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,14,1,15,"She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,14,1,17,Think it'll work?
Chandler Bing,Sad,1,14,1,18,"No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg."
Monica Geller,Mad,1,14,2,1,You can not do this.
Rachel Green,Scared,1,14,2,2,"Do what, do what?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,14,2,3,Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
Rachel Green,Scared,1,14,2,4,No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,14,2,5,"'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!"
Monica Geller,Peaceful,1,14,2,6,"But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,1,14,2,7,"Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,14,2,8,"Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes."
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,14,2,9,"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight..."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,14,2,10,"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend."
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,14,2,11,"Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a..."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,14,2,12,"Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,14,2,13,Hi. She said yes.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,14,2,14,"Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,14,3,1,How do I look?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,14,3,2,"Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess."
Lorraine,Joyful,1,14,3,3,"Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,14,3,4,...And what did you bring?
Lorraine,Neutral,1,14,3,5,"She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,14,3,6,Janice?
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,1,14,3,8,Oh.... my.... God.
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,14,3,9,"Hey, it's Janice."
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,14,4,1,"Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,14,4,2,"No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down."
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,14,4,3,Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,14,4,4,"Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous."
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,14,4,5,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!"
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,14,5,1,"Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,14,5,2,Which one was Pete Carney?
Rachel Green,Mad,1,14,5,3,"Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. ""Was it good for you?"""
Monica Geller,Mad,1,14,5,4,"Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-""I-win""-guy. ""I win! I win!"" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once."
Rachel Green,Mad,1,14,5,5,How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,14,5,6,I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,14,5,7,I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,14,5,8,"There's more beer, right?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,14,5,9,"Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,14,5,10,"Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,14,5,11,"Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,14,5,12,"Ok, well, what kind of ritual?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,14,5,13,"Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,14,5,14,Or?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,14,5,15,"Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks."
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,14,5,16,Burning's good.
Rachel Green,Powerful,1,14,5,17,"Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Sad,1,14,8,1,"Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?"
Chandler Bing,Powerful,1,14,8,2,"No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,1,14,8,3,Kiss me!
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,14,8,5,"Oh, Chandler, sorry."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,14,8,7,"Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Neutral,1,14,8,8,"Hi, Monica."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,14,8,9,"Ok, well, this was very special."
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,14,8,10,"Rach, come see who's out here!"
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,14,8,12,"Oh my god. Janice, hi!"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,1,14,8,13,Janice is gonna go away now.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,14,8,14,I'll be right back.
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,14,8,16,"Oh, Joey, look who it is."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,14,8,17,Whoa.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,14,8,18,"Oh, good, Joey's home now."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,1,14,8,19,This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,14,8,21,"Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,1,14,8,22,"Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,14,9,1,"I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half."
Kristin,Joyful,1,14,9,3,That's funny. Who are they?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,14,9,4,"The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend."
Kristin,Neutral,1,14,9,5,You mean they're lovers.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,14,9,6,If you wanna put a label on it.
Kristin,Scared,1,14,9,7,"Wow, uh, anything else I should know?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,14,9,8,"Nope, nope, that's it."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,14,9,10,"Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo!"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,14,10,1,"Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,14,10,2,"All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,14,10,3,"Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,14,10,4,"Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,14,10,5,Can we just start throwing things in?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,14,10,6,"Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,14,10,7,"Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,14,10,8,"Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah."
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,14,10,9,"Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,14,10,10,Hey he's wearing a sweater.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,14,10,11,No.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,14,10,13,And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
Monica Geller,Scared,1,14,10,14,"Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure..."
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,14,11,1,How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,14,11,2,I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,14,11,3,"Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Neutral,1,14,11,5,"Hello, funny Valentine."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,14,11,6,"Hi, Just Janice."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,1,14,11,7,"Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,14,11,9,"If you don't do it, I will."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,14,12,1,"So, um, what do you do for a living?"
Kristin,Neutral,1,14,12,2,"Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.. ...which is funny because, that wasn't even my major."
Carol Willick,Joyful,1,14,12,3,Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
Susan Bunch,Sad,1,14,12,4,I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,14,12,5,"Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad."
Kristin,Peaceful,1,14,12,6,I guess.
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,14,12,7,Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
Carol Willick,Joyful,1,14,12,8,"Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine."
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,14,12,9,"Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin... ...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!"
Fireman No. 1,Neutral,1,14,13,1,What do we got there?
Fireman No. 2,Joyful,1,14,13,2,"A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,14,13,3,"You know, it's a really funny story how this happened."
Fireman No. 3,Peaceful,1,14,13,4,It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
Fireman No. 1,Peaceful,1,14,13,5,You're our third call tonight.
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,14,13,6,Really?
Fireman No. 2,Joyful,1,14,13,7,"Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Neutral,1,14,14,1,I brought you something.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,14,14,2,"Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,1,14,14,3,I had them made special.
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,14,14,4,"Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Neutral,1,14,14,5,That's fine.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,14,14,6,It is?
Janice Litman Goralnik,Powerful,1,14,14,7,Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,14,14,8,"Oh no, you see, actually it is."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Neutral,1,14,14,9,"No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,1,14,14,10,"Oh, no I don't."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Powerful,1,14,14,11,Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,1,14,14,12,"I did, but..."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Powerful,1,14,14,13,"You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,14,14,15,Call me!
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,14,15,1,It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
Ross Geller,Mad,1,14,15,2,"You did so. I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom?"
Carol Willick,Scared,1,14,15,3,"Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,14,15,4,Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,14,15,5,That could be it.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,14,15,6,"Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot."
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,14,15,7,"Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,1,14,15,8,"No, it's just...you know the whole ""getting on with your life"" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you."
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,14,15,10,"Oh, I love you too. But..."
Ross Geller,Scared,1,14,15,11,"No but, no but."
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,14,15,12,"You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,14,15,13,"That's easy for you to say, you found one already."
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,14,15,14,All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,14,15,16,Not her.
Fireman No. 3,Neutral,1,14,16,1,"We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,14,16,2,"So, um, will you bring the truck?"
Fireman No. 3,Joyful,1,14,16,3,I'll even let you ring the bell.
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,14,16,4,"Oh, my god."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,14,16,5,"See, there you go, the cleansing works!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,14,16,6,They're nice guys.
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,14,16,7,"Oh, they're firemen guys."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,15,1,1,Coffee.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,15,1,2,Thank you.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,15,1,3,Cappuccino.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,15,1,4,Grazie.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,15,1,5,And a nice hot cider for Monica.
Monica Geller,Scared,1,15,1,6,"Aww, thank you. Uh Rach?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,15,1,7,Yeah?
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,15,1,8,Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,15,1,9,Oh! That's why. I'm sorry!
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,15,6,1,"OK, try this salmon mousse."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,15,6,2,Mmmm. Good.
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,15,6,3,Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,1,15,6,4,It's creamier.
Monica Geller,Mad,1,15,6,5,"Yeah, well, is that better?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,15,6,6,"I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?"
Rachel Green,Scared,1,15,6,8,My God! What happened to you?
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,15,6,9,"Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? ""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."""
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,15,6,10,That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,15,6,11,"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,15,6,12,"Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!"
Monica Geller,Peaceful,1,15,6,13,"Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up."
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,15,6,14,"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you."
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,15,6,15,It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,15,6,16,Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,15,6,18,"Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,15,6,19,Ten dollars an hour for what?
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,15,6,20,"Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out."
Rachel Green,Mad,1,15,6,21,Waitressing?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,15,6,22,Uh-oh.
Monica Geller,Sad,1,15,6,23,Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
Rachel Green,Mad,1,15,6,24,"But, but?"
Monica Geller,Mad,1,15,6,25,"But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress."
Rachel Green,Mad,1,15,6,26,Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,15,6,27,"You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?"
Celia,Neutral,1,15,7,1,Talk to me.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,15,7,2,"OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning..."
Celia,Joyful,1,15,7,3,No no no. Talk... dirty.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,15,7,4,"Wha... what, here?"
Celia,Neutral,1,15,7,5,Yes...
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,15,7,6,Ah....
Celia,Neutral,1,15,7,7,Say something..... hot.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,15,7,8,Er.... um.....
Celia,Neutral,1,15,7,9,What?
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,15,7,10,Um... uh.... vulva.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,15,9,1,Well?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,15,9,2,"Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,15,9,3,Look at this!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,15,9,4,Oh! You have a window!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,15,9,5,Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,15,9,6,Oh look! That guy's peeing!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,15,9,7,"OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,15,9,8,OK.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,1,15,9,9,"This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,15,9,11,"Thank you Helen, that'll be all."
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,15,9,13,"Last time I do that, I promise."
Monica Geller,Mad,1,15,10,1,"Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!"
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,15,10,2,Who was that?
Monica Geller,Mad,1,15,10,3,Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,15,10,4,Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,15,10,5,Ten dollars an hour.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,15,10,6,No.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,15,10,7,Twelve dollars an hour.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,15,10,8,"Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around."
Monica Geller,Scared,1,15,10,9,"You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,15,10,10,Done.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,15,12,1,What a tool!
Rachel Green,Powerful,1,15,12,2,You don't want to work for a guy like that.
Ross Geller,Powerful,1,15,12,3,Yeah!
Monica Geller,Sad,1,15,12,4,"I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it."
Ross Geller,Powerful,1,15,12,5,"Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,15,12,6,Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,15,12,8,"So, er... how did it go with Celia?"
Ross Geller,Powerful,1,15,12,9,"Oh, I was unbelievable."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,1,15,12,10,"All right, Ross!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,15,12,11,"I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,15,12,12,Whoa! And the... huh-huh?
Ross Geller,Scared,1,15,12,13,"Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh..."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,15,12,14,You cuddled.
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,15,12,15,"Yeah, which was nice."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,15,12,16,You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,15,12,17,"Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,15,12,18,"Yeah, where the hell is he?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,15,14,1,How's this?
Steve (drug addict),Joyful,1,15,14,2,Eeeee!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,15,14,3,Sorry. How about over here?
Steve (drug addict),Joyful,1,15,14,4,Aaaaah!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,15,14,5,"See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt?"
Steve (drug addict),Neutral,1,15,14,6,No.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,15,14,7,What about this?
Steve (drug addict),Mad,1,15,14,8,Aaaaahhh!!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,15,14,9,There you go!
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,16,1,1,"This is unbelievable. Its been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, youd be looking like a ham right about now."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,16,1,3,"Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,16,1,5,Its Phoebe! Hi!
Ursula,Neutral,1,16,1,7,"Hi. Okay, will that be all?"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,1,16,1,8,"Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?"
Ursula,Neutral,1,16,1,9,"Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, ""Excuse me, hello Miss,"" so now Im here."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,16,1,10,"No, no... how come you are working here?"
Ursula,Neutral,1,16,1,11,"Right, yeah, cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,16,1,12,Can we start over?
Ursula,Neutral,1,16,1,13,Yeah. Okay great. Im gonna be over here.
Woman,Neutral,1,16,3,1,"Hi, were the Rostins. Err, Im J.C., and hes Michael, and were having a boy, and a girl."

Carol Willick,Neutral,1,16,3,6,Life partner.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,16,3,7,Like buddies.
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,16,3,8,Like lovers.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,16,3,9,You know how close women can get.
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,16,3,11,Susan and I live together.
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,16,3,12,Although I was married to her.
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,16,3,13,"Carol, not me."
Ross Geller,Scared,1,16,3,14,"Err, right."
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,16,3,15,Its a little complicated.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,16,3,16,A little.
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,16,3,17,But were fine.
Ross Geller,Powerful,1,16,3,18,"Absolutely. So, twins... hah! Thats like two births. Ouch."
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,16,4,2,"And to you too, Helen."
Helen,Neutral,1,16,4,3,Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,16,4,4,"Oh, okay. Send her in."
Nina Bookbinder,Neutral,1,16,4,6,Hi.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,16,4,7,"Hi, Nina. Come on in."
Nina Bookbinder,Neutral,1,16,4,8,You wanted to see me?
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,16,4,9,"Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers."
Nina Bookbinder,Neutral,1,16,4,10,"Which is bad, because?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,16,4,11,"Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack."
Nina Bookbinder,Neutral,1,16,4,12,Your... excuse me?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,16,4,13,WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...
Nina Bookbinder,Neutral,1,16,4,14,"Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Wont happen again. I wouldnt want to do anything to hurt your... ""wenus."""
Ross Geller,Sad,1,16,6,1,Sorry.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,16,6,2,"Hi. Sorry Im late. Wheres, wheres Carol?"
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,16,6,3,Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information.
Ross Geller,Powerful,1,16,6,4,"No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know whats going on."
Susan Bunch,Joyful,1,16,6,5,"Oh, good. Thisll be fun."
Teacher,Neutral,1,16,6,6,"Alrighty. Were gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so Mummies, why dont you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummys head."
Susan Bunch,Scared,1,16,6,9,I am supposed to be the mommy?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,16,6,10,"Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time."
Susan Bunch,Mad,1,16,6,11,"Look, I dont see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,16,6,12,I see. So what do you propose to do?
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,16,6,13,I will flip you for it.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,16,6,14,"Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!"
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,16,6,15,On your back... Mom.
Teacher,Neutral,1,16,6,17,"Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath."
Teacher,Joyful,1,16,6,19,Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,16,7,1,"Mr. D, hows it going, sir?"
Mr. Douglas,Neutral,1,16,7,2,"Ohh, its been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,16,7,3,And?
Mr. Douglas,Sad,1,16,7,4,Its pretty ugly. We havent seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,16,7,5,So what does this mean?
Mr. Douglas,Sad,1,16,7,6,"Well, were gonna be layin off people in every department."
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,16,7,7,"Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;"
Mr. Douglas,Neutral,1,16,7,8,Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,16,8,1,Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
Nina Bookbinder,Neutral,1,16,8,3,Are you okay?
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,16,8,4,"Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me."
Nina Bookbinder,Neutral,1,16,8,5,What?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,16,8,6,Would you like to have dinner sometime?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,16,11,1,And thats the Chrysler Building right there.
Mr. Douglas,Neutral,1,16,11,2,Nina.
Nina Bookbinder,Joyful,1,16,11,3,Mr.Douglas... ..cool tie.
Mr. Douglas,Joyful,1,16,11,5,Shes still here.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,16,11,6,"Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan."
Chandler Bing,Sad,1,16,11,8,"And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy."
Mr. Douglas,Neutral,1,16,11,9,Youre kidding? She seems so...
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,16,11,10,"Oh, no, no. Nina... ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all."
Mr. Douglas,Neutral,1,16,11,11,Thats unbelievable.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,16,11,12,"And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others."
Mr. Douglas,Scared,1,16,11,13,I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,16,11,14,"Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir."
Soothing Male Voice,Joyful,1,16,12,1,"..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth."
Teacher,Neutral,1,16,12,2,Lights please? And thats having a baby. Next week is our final class.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,16,12,4,"Susan, go deep."
Carol Willick,Mad,1,16,12,6,This is impossible. Its just impossible.
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,16,12,7,"What is, honey?"
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,16,12,8,"What that woman... did. I am not doin that. Its just gonna have to stay in, thats all, everything will be the same, itll just stay in."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,16,12,9,"Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everythings gonna be alright."
Carol Willick,Mad,1,16,12,10,"Oh, what do you know? No one's going up to you and saying, ""Hi, is that your nostril? Mind if we push this pot roast through it?"""
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,16,12,11,"Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath."
Susan Bunch,Scared,1,16,12,13,"I know its frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when its over, were all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives."
Susan Bunch,Scared,1,16,12,15,"I mean, thats what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?"
Ross Geller,Scared,1,16,13,1,Im gonna be a father.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,16,13,2,This is just occurring to you?
Ross Geller,Scared,1,16,13,3,"I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,16,13,4,"Oh, youre gonna be great!"
Ross Geller,Scared,1,16,13,5,"Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,16,13,6,"You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,16,13,8,Wherere you going?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,16,13,9,Out.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,16,13,10,With?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,16,13,11,Yes.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,16,13,12,"Alright, could I just ask you one question?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,16,13,14,"Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,16,13,15,"Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,16,13,17,"You meant sex, right?"
Nina Bookbinder,Neutral,1,16,14,1,Do you have a sec?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,16,14,2,"Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?"
Nina Bookbinder,Neutral,1,16,14,3,"I dont know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,16,14,4,"Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us."
Nina Bookbinder,Neutral,1,16,14,5,Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,16,14,6,"Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise."
Nina Bookbinder,Neutral,1,16,14,7,I am?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,16,14,8,"Sure, why not?"
Nina Bookbinder,Joyful,1,16,14,9,Oh my god! Youre amazing!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,16,14,10,"Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?"
Helen,Neutral,1,16,14,11,So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?
Nina Bookbinder,Neutral,1,16,14,12,What?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,16,14,13,Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,16,15,1,"Well, I ended up telling her everything."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,16,15,2,"Oh, howd she take it?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,16,15,3,"Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... ..on the desk."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,1,16,15,4,"Okay, I think I get how to do this."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,16,15,6,"Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,1,16,15,7,"okay, Pheebs, theyre gone."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,1,16,15,8,Okay.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,1,16,15,9,Are you alright?
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,1,16,15,10,"Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its..."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,16,15,11,"Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?"
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,1,16,15,12,"Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,1,16,15,14,"Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us."
Rachel Green,Sad,1,16,15,15,"Oh... Oh, Pheebs."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,1,16,15,16,"I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but..."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,1,16,15,17,Youre not gonna lose him.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,1,16,15,18,"Hon, you gotta talk to Joey."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,16,15,19,Yeah. Okay.
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,16,15,20,"No, come on, he doesnt know this stuff. If he knew how you felt."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,1,16,15,21,But hes falling in love with her.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,1,16,15,22,"Oh please, theyve been going out a week. They havent even slept together yet, I mean, thats not serious."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,16,15,23,Okay... Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,16,15,25,"Oh, okay, oh."
Ursula,Scared,1,16,15,27,Oh.
Ursula,Neutral,1,16,15,29,"Yeah, um, may we help you?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,16,16,1,"Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you come back inside?"
Rachel Green,Scared,1,16,16,2,"No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa!"
Monica Geller,Scared,1,16,16,4,Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,16,16,6,"Im okay! Im okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?"
Mr. Heckles,Neutral,1,16,16,7,"See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,1,17,2,1,I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,17,2,3,"No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,17,2,4,Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,17,2,5,"Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field."
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,17,2,6,What are you crazy? That's a baby!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,17,2,7,He should take the sack?
Ross Geller,Scared,1,17,2,8,"Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,17,2,9,"Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,1,17,2,10,"Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,17,2,12,"Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,17,2,13,"Well, only if you order stuff."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,17,2,14,I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,17,2,15,Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,17,2,16,When's that?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,17,2,17,Tonight.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,17,2,18,"Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,17,2,20,You take your time.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,17,2,22,There it is! So what're you gonna do?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,17,2,23,"What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,17,2,24,And your friend Phoebe?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,17,2,25,"Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?"
Chandler Bing,Powerful,1,17,2,26,"Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit."
Dr. Mitchell,Neutral,1,17,3,1,"..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference."
Dr. Mitchell,Neutral,1,17,3,3,"Okay, errrr, Monica?"
Monica Geller,Sad,1,17,3,4,"Yes? ..yes, she is."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,17,3,5,"Hi, this is my friend Rachel."

Dr. Rosen,Scared,1,17,3,11,Excuse me?
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,17,3,12,"I meant er, young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,17,3,13,Thank you.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,17,3,14,Right.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,17,4,1,"..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,17,4,2,"Uh, you left out the stupid part."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,17,4,3,"Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said ""yes."""
Monica Geller,Scared,1,17,4,4,"I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,17,4,5,"What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,17,4,6,"Alright, what have we learned so far?"
The Whole Party,Joyful,1,17,4,8,SURPRISE!!!

Monica Geller,Neutral,1,17,4,19,"Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses."
Ross Geller,Mad,1,17,4,21,"Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,17,4,22,"Hey, what's going on?"

Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,17,4,27,Did you see Betty?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,17,5,1,"I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say ""get out of my office!"""
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,17,5,2,"Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,17,5,3,"I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;"
Ross Geller,Scared,1,17,5,4,"Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, ""Oh my god I'm gonna be a father"" kind of a thing?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,17,5,5,No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,17,5,6,"No, no, Dad, I was just wondering."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,17,5,7,'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
Ross Geller,Scared,1,17,5,8,"Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,1,17,5,9,"Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,17,5,11,So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,17,5,12,"No, we can go to Williamsburg."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,17,5,13,Eat your fish.
Rachel Green,Scared,1,17,7,1,"Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! ...dead!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,17,7,3,"Ross, he's got the remote again."
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,17,7,4,Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,17,7,6,Maybe not.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,17,7,8,"Hello? Um, yeah, uh, Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here."
Rachel Green,Scared,1,17,7,10,"It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god..."
Monica Geller,Scared,1,17,7,12,I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
Rachel Green,Scared,1,17,7,13,"Okay no, you do it."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,17,7,14,"Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you."
Rachel Green,Scared,1,17,7,15,What?
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,17,7,16,We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,17,7,17,"Ohhh... Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,17,7,18,Thank you.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,17,7,19,"Okay, let me just change."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,17,7,20,Yes.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,17,7,22,Hey.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,17,7,24,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,17,7,25,Trouble?
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,1,17,7,26,Your sister stood me up the other night.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,1,17,7,27,"Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,17,7,28,Well did you try calling her?
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,1,17,7,29,"I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,17,9,1,"Hi, remember us?"
Nurse Sizemore,Neutral,1,17,9,2,Mmm hmmm.
Monica Geller,Scared,1,17,9,3,"Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. 'cause um..."
Nurse Sizemore,Mad,1,17,9,4,You're that stupid.
Monica Geller,Scared,1,17,9,5,I am. I'm that stupid.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,1,17,9,6,"Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check."
Nurse Sizemore,Neutral,1,17,9,7,"Well, you know your insurance will cover that."
Rachel Green,Scared,1,17,9,8,"Yeah, I know... ..I'm I'm just not that bright either."
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,17,10,1,"Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,17,10,2,Uh-huh.
Chandler Bing,Sad,1,17,10,3,"Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,17,10,4,Do you have a point?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,17,10,5,"You know, you think I would."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,17,10,7,What's up with the simian?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,17,10,8,It's just a fur ball.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,17,10,9,Okay... ..whose turn is it?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,17,10,10,"Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,17,10,11,"No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,17,10,12,I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
Ross Geller,Scared,1,17,11,1,You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
Nurse Sizemore,Mad,1,17,11,3,You go get that animal outta here.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,17,11,4,"No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,17,11,5,What's goin' on?
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,17,11,7,Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
Rachel Green,Scared,1,17,11,8,Oh.
Nurse Sizemore,Mad,1,17,11,10,Excuse me... This hospital is for people!
Ross Geller,Scared,1,17,11,11,"Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!"
Dr. Mitchell,Neutral,1,17,11,13,I'll take a look at him.

Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,17,12,6,"No, no, no, don't say ""listen."" I know that ""listen."" I've said that ""listen."""
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,1,17,12,7,I'm sorry.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,17,12,8,I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,1,17,12,10,": Yeah, um... You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,17,12,11,You don't drink.
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,1,17,12,12,"That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,1,17,12,13,"Oh, Urse..."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,17,12,14,"Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,17,12,15,Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,17,12,16,"If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,17,12,17,"no. No, I, I couldn't do that."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,1,17,12,18,"Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,1,17,12,19,"Then, uh, then I'm sorry."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,1,17,12,21,"You know... You're gonna be really, really hard to get over."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,1,17,12,22,I know...
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,1,17,12,24,"I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,17,12,25,Really?

Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,17,13,4,Is he alright?
Ross Geller,Scared,1,17,13,5,Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,17,13,6,We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,17,13,8,"Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now."
Chandler Bing,Sad,1,17,13,9,"So, you feel like a dad yet?"
Ross Geller,Scared,1,17,13,10,"No, why?"

Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,18,6,3,"Alright, here's my $7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,18,6,4,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,18,6,5,"Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,18,6,6,"That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,18,6,7,"Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen..."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,18,6,8,"Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women."
Monica Geller,Mad,1,18,6,9,"You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,18,6,10,"Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,18,8,1,Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,18,8,3,"Oh, time's up."
Monica Geller,Sad,1,18,8,4,Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,18,8,5,Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,18,8,6,That's a bird?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,18,8,8,That's a bird!
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,18,8,10,"OK, OK, it's my turn."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,18,8,11,Go.
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,18,8,13,Uh.... bean! Bean!
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,1,18,8,15,The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,18,8,16,Yes!
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,18,8,17,"That, you get? That, you get?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,19,2,1,"Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,19,2,2,"Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,19,2,3,Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,19,2,4,Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,19,2,5,What is it?
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,19,2,6,"Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,19,2,7,Barry who you almost...?
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,19,2,8,Barry who I almost.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,19,2,9,"And Mindy, your maid of...?"
Rachel Green,Powerful,1,19,2,10,"Mindy, my maid of. Oh!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,19,2,11,"That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. Lucky. To have had a friend like you."
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,19,4,1,I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,19,4,2,"I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,19,4,3,"I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,19,4,4,"I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,19,4,5,She really said that?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,19,4,6,"Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,19,4,7,'Tonight' tonight?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,19,4,8,"Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey..."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,19,4,9,I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,19,4,10,"Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,19,4,11,"Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,19,8,1,"It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,19,8,2,"Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit."
Ross Geller,Sad,1,19,8,3,"Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I..."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,19,8,4,"Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your..."
Ross Geller,Scared,1,19,8,5,"Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,19,8,6,That'd be good.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,19,8,7,"Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um..."
Barry Farber,Neutral,1,19,8,9,Rachel.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,19,8,10,Barry?!
Barry Farber,Scared,1,19,8,11,"I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,19,8,13,We have got to start locking that door!
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,19,9,1,This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,19,9,2,Nope.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,19,9,3,That's because I'm in front of them.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,19,9,4,Eh. I thought that was an alp.
Monica Geller,Sad,1,19,9,5,"Well, high school was not my favourite time."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,19,9,6,"I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,19,9,7,"Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,19,9,8,"Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,19,9,9,Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,20,1,1,I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,1,20,1,2,"No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,1,20,1,3,"I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy."
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,20,1,4,Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
Ross Geller,Mad,1,20,1,5,I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Rachel Green,Scared,1,20,1,6,"Oh, that is so sick."
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,20,1,7,I feel violated. And not in a good way.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,1,20,1,8,"How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!"
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,20,3,1,Wow... Wow!
Barry Farber,Neutral,1,20,3,2,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Scared,1,20,3,3,"I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that."
Barry Farber,Neutral,1,20,3,4,"Nooo, it wasn't."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,1,20,3,5,"Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here..."
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,20,4,1,"Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye-bye. Oh God!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,20,4,2,That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,20,4,3,"Hey, I've been honing!"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,20,4,4,What was with the dishes?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,20,4,5,"Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,20,4,6,"Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!"
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,1,20,4,7,Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,20,4,8,"Great, now he's waving back."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,20,4,9,"Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,20,4,10,What kinda stuff?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,20,4,11,"Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,20,4,12,You cook naked?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,20,4,13,"Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,20,4,15,What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
Barry Farber,Scared,1,20,5,1,What's the matter?
Rachel Green,Sad,1,20,5,2,"Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good."
Barry Farber,Joyful,1,20,5,3,"No, it was. It was very very good."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,20,5,4,"Well, what about Mindy?"
Barry Farber,Peaceful,1,20,5,5,"Oh, way, way better than Mindy."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,20,5,6,"No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?"
Barry Farber,Scared,1,20,5,7,"Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her."
Rachel Green,Scared,1,20,5,8,"No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me."
Bernice,Neutral,1,20,5,9,"Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment."
Barry Farber,Powerful,1,20,5,10,"Thanks, Bernice. Let's go away this weekend."
Rachel Green,Scared,1,20,5,11,"Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too.."
Barry Farber,Joyful,1,20,5,12,"We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,20,5,14,I had a bra.
Bobby Rush,Neutral,1,20,5,16,"Hey, Dr. Farber."
Barry Farber,Neutral,1,20,5,18,"All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,20,5,20,What?!
Bobby Rush,Mad,1,20,5,21,"I'm twelve, I'm not stupid."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,20,7,1,Brrrrrrr!
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,20,7,3,Hell is filled with people like you.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,20,7,4,He's back! The peeper's back!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,20,7,6,Get down!
Rachel Green,Scared,1,20,7,7,Get down?
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,20,7,8,...And boogie!
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,20,7,9,"Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy."
Monica Geller,Scared,1,20,7,10,"Relax. Y'know, she may not even know."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,20,7,11,"Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss.."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,20,7,12,Yeah?
Rachel Green,Sad,1,20,7,13,"And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so.."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,20,7,14,..Naughty!
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,20,7,15,"Right, I'll see you guys later..."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,20,7,16,"Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- That's fine, yeah..."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,20,7,18,"Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,20,7,19,Why don't you just take it with you?
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,20,7,20,"Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,20,7,21,Why don't you just call her?
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,20,7,22,"I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,20,7,23,Do you?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,20,7,24,"No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back..."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,20,7,25,Don't you have to pee?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,20,7,26,'S'why I'm dancing...
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,20,9,1,"Four letters: ""Circle or hoop""."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,20,9,2,"Ring dammit, ring!"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,20,9,3,Thanks.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,20,9,4,"Hey, you know our phone's not working?"
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,20,9,5,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,20,9,6,"I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer."
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,20,9,7,"I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,20,9,8,Just like you told her you did! ... Just pointing out the irony.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,20,9,9,"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,20,9,10,Nngghhh!!!!!!!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,20,9,11,"Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,20,9,12,"""Heating device."""
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,20,9,13,Radiator.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,20,9,14,Five letters.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,20,9,15,Rdtor.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,20,9,16,"Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,20,9,17,So she's a woman! So what?
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,20,9,18,"Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally.."
Monica Geller,Mad,1,20,9,19,Joey!!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,20,9,20,"Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress."
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,20,9,21,The green dress? Really?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,20,9,22,"Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day."
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,20,9,23,Nooo!
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,20,11,1,You okay?
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,20,11,2,Yeah.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,20,11,3,Really?
Rachel Green,Sad,1,20,11,4,"Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,1,20,11,5,Aww...
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,20,11,7,Big day.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,20,12,1,"All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat..."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,20,12,2,You know he's gay?
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,20,12,3,I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
Danielle,Neutral,1,20,12,4,Chandler?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,20,12,5,"Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody."
#ALL#,Neutral,1,20,12,6,Hi. Hi.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,20,12,7,What are you doing here?
Danielle,Neutral,1,20,12,8,"Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,20,12,9,"...I'm, I'm okay."
Danielle,Neutral,1,20,12,10,"Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,20,12,11,"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever..."
Danielle,Neutral,1,20,12,12,You got it.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,20,12,13,Okay.
Danielle,Neutral,1,20,12,14,"G'bye, everybody."
#ALL#,Neutral,1,20,12,15,Bye.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,20,12,16,Whoo-hoo!
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,20,12,17,"Yeah, there you go!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,20,12,18,Second date!
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,20,12,19,...I dunno.
Rachel Green,Mad,1,20,12,20,You don't know?!
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,20,12,21,"Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,21,1,1,How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
Monica Geller,Mad,1,21,1,2,I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Rachel Green,Peaceful,1,21,1,3,"Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought."
Monica Geller,Sad,1,21,1,4,I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,21,1,5,"I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,21,1,6,"Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,21,1,7,That's me.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,21,1,8,"Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!"
Ross Geller,Mad,1,21,1,9,"Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- come here, Marcel-"
Rachel Green,Scared,1,21,1,10,"Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,21,1,11,"Ross, you've got to do something about the humping."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,21,1,12,"What? It's, it's just a phase."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,21,1,13,"Well, that's what we said about Joey..."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,21,1,14,Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
Rachel Green,Mad,1,21,1,15,Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,21,1,16,What?
Rachel Green,Sad,1,21,1,17,Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,21,2,1,"Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,21,2,2,This woman's living my life.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,21,2,3,What?
Monica Geller,Sad,1,21,2,4,"She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,21,2,5,You're not an artist.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,21,2,6,"Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,1,21,2,7,"Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,21,2,8,"Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,21,2,9,"Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'..."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,21,2,10,Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
Rachel Green,Sad,1,21,2,11,Nooo...
Monica Geller,Mad,1,21,2,12,"This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,21,3,1,How about Joey... Pepponi?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,21,3,2,"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,21,3,3,Joey... Switzerland?
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,1,21,3,5,"Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,1,21,3,6,Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,1,21,3,7,Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,21,3,8,"Well, it does not ring a bell with me..."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,21,3,9,"Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,21,3,10,Might wanna try Joseph.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,21,3,12,Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,21,3,13,"Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,21,4,1,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,21,4,2,Hey.
Monica Geller,Scared,1,21,4,3,"Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,21,4,4,What are you doing?
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,21,4,5,"Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,21,4,6,"What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,21,4,7,"This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is."
Rachel Green,Scared,1,21,4,8,"Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,1,21,4,9,"This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you."
Ross Geller,Scared,1,21,6,1,Hi.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,21,6,3,Where've you been?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,21,6,4,At the vet.
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,21,6,5,"She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,21,6,6,She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,21,6,7,Hey! He beat ya.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,21,6,8,"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,21,6,9,So what does this mean?
Ross Geller,Sad,1,21,6,10,I'm gonna have to give him up.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,21,7,1,"I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,21,7,2,"I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?"
Ross Geller,Sad,1,21,7,3,"I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,21,7,4,Isn't there any way you can keep him?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,21,7,5,"No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,21,7,6,How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,21,7,7,"I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,21,7,8,"Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,21,7,9,"Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,1,21,7,11,"Hey. We found her, we found the girl."
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,21,7,12,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,21,7,13,Did you call the cops?
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,21,7,14,Nope. We took her to lunch.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,1,21,7,15,Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
Ross Geller,Mad,1,21,7,16,What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,21,7,17,"Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit."
Ross Geller,Mad,1,21,7,18,"Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,21,7,19,...Take off their hats!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,21,7,20,Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
Rachel Green,Scared,1,21,8,1,No way. No way did you do this.
Fake Monica,Powerful,1,21,8,2,Monana was very brave.
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,21,8,3,It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
Fake Monica,Joyful,1,21,8,4,"So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts..."
Monica Geller,Mad,1,21,8,5,...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Rachel Green,Powerful,1,21,8,6,"Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up."
Fake Monica,Neutral,1,21,8,7,"Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show."
Monica Geller,Scared,1,21,8,8,'Scuse me?
Fake Monica,Neutral,1,21,8,9,"There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?"
Monica Geller,Scared,1,21,8,10,"Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class."
Fake Monica,Neutral,1,21,8,11,"Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background."
Monica Geller,Scared,1,21,8,12,What?
Fake Monica,Neutral,1,21,8,13,"Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?"
Monica Geller,Mad,1,21,8,14,"Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned."
Fake Monica,Neutral,1,21,8,15,I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,21,8,16,Uh-huh.
Fake Monica,Joyful,1,21,8,17,"I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,21,8,18,Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,21,9,1,"Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,21,9,2,I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
Ross Geller,Sad,1,21,9,3,"Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,1,21,9,4,"Oh, somebody will."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,21,9,5,You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,21,9,6,You're kidding.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,21,9,7,Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,21,9,8,"Y'know, you'd think I would've."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,21,9,9,Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,21,9,10,...Flame Boy.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,21,10,1,Where exactly is your zoo?
Dr. Baldhara,Neutral,1,21,10,2,"Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,21,10,3,Yes.
Dr. Baldhara,Scared,1,21,10,4,"Does he, uh, fight with other animals?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,21,10,5,"No-no, he's, he's very docile."
Dr. Baldhara,Neutral,1,21,10,6,Even if he were... cornered?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,21,10,7,"Well I, I don't know. Why?"
Dr. Baldhara,Neutral,1,21,10,8,"Uh, how is he at handling small objects?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,21,10,9,"He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean..."
Dr. Baldhara,Neutral,1,21,10,10,"How about a hammer, or a small blade?"
Ross Geller,Scared,1,21,10,11,Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Dr. Baldhara,Neutral,1,21,10,12,"Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,21,10,15,"We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing..."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,21,10,16,...He's in.
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,21,10,17,"He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!"
Dr. Baldhara,Neutral,1,21,10,18,"You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains."
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,21,11,1,Yo- hooo!
Rachel Green,Mad,1,21,11,2,Where the hell've you been?
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,21,11,3,Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Rachel Green,Mad,1,21,11,4,Are you drunk?!
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,21,11,5,Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Rachel Green,Scared,1,21,11,6,"Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried..."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,21,11,8,Monica? Monica!
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,21,11,9,Water rules!
Rachel Green,Scared,1,21,11,10,"Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,21,11,11,Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Rachel Green,Mad,1,21,11,12,"Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,21,11,13,"No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!"
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,21,11,15,"Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people."
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,21,11,16,Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,21,11,17,What?
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,21,11,18,They've arrested Monica.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,21,12,1,Hi.
Fake Monica,Neutral,1,21,12,2,Hey.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,21,12,3,How are you?
Fake Monica,Neutral,1,21,12,4,"I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?"
Monica Geller,Mad,1,21,12,5,Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
Fake Monica,Scared,1,21,12,6,That I was not expecting.
Monica Geller,Sad,1,21,12,7,"I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in."
Fake Monica,Neutral,1,21,12,8,Oh. Thanks.
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,21,12,9,"No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!"
Fake Monica,Neutral,1,21,12,10,"Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'."
Monica Geller,Sad,1,21,12,11,"I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?"
Fake Monica,Joyful,1,21,12,12,"Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?"
Monica Geller,Sad,1,21,12,13,"Well, not... worried, just... wondering."
Fake Monica,Neutral,1,21,12,14,"There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,21,12,15,Not necessarily...
Fake Monica,Joyful,1,21,12,16,"Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,21,12,17,"Um, I'm not actually Amish."
Fake Monica,Neutral,1,21,12,18,Really? Then why are you like that?
Announcement,Neutral,1,21,14,1,"This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,1,21,14,2,"Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,1,21,14,3,"Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,21,14,4,Oh!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,21,14,5,"Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,21,14,6,"I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,21,14,7,"Just, just say what you feel."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,21,14,8,"Marcel, I'm hungry."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,21,14,9,That was good.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,1,21,14,10,"Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,1,21,14,11,"Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him."
#ALL#,Neutral,1,21,14,12,"Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely."
Ross Geller,Mad,1,21,14,13,"Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him."
Actor,Scared,1,21,15,1,"Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek..."
Casting Director No. 1,Neutral,1,21,15,2,"That's fine, thank you."
Casting Director No. 2,Neutral,1,21,15,3,Next.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,21,15,4,"Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio."
Casting Director No. 2,Neutral,1,21,15,5,Name?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,21,15,6,Holden McGroin.
Monica Geller,Powerful,1,22,1,1,Tell him.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,22,1,2,No.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,1,22,1,3,"Tell him, tell him."
Monica Geller,Powerful,1,22,1,4,Just...please tell him.
Rachel Green,Mad,1,22,1,5,Shut up!
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,22,1,6,Tell me what?
Monica Geller,Powerful,1,22,1,7,"Look at you, you won't even look at him."
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,22,1,8,"Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me."
Rachel Green,Scared,1,22,1,9,"All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were..."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,22,1,10,Doing it on this table.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,22,1,11,Wow!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,22,1,12,Exellent dream score.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,22,1,13,"Why, why, why would you dream that?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,22,1,14,"More importantly, was I any good?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,22,1,15,"Well, you were pretty damn good."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,22,1,16,"Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,22,1,17,"Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table."
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,22,1,18,"I love it, when we share."
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,22,1,20,You're okay there?
Ross Geller,Mad,1,22,1,21,I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,22,1,22,"I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious."
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,22,3,1,Can you hear that?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,22,3,2,Yeah?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,22,3,3,See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,22,3,4,"Oh. Uh, I'm on."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,1,22,3,5,"Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now."
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,22,3,6,I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,22,3,7,"Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,22,3,8,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,22,3,9,Ross says hi.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,22,3,10,Ah!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,22,3,11,"This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,22,3,12,"Well, now, I actually have to get to work."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,22,3,13,"Most likely. Okay, I'm gonna be out there."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,22,3,14,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,22,3,15,All right. Bye bye.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,22,3,16,Bye bye.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,22,3,18,Yes?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,22,3,19,Whatcha doin'?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,22,3,20,Ooh.
Monica Geller,Scared,1,22,4,1,"Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,22,4,2,"Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh."
Monica Geller,Scared,1,22,4,3,What?
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,22,4,4,Could tonight be the Night?
Monica Geller,Scared,1,22,4,5,"I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,22,4,6,"So, did you shave your legs?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,22,4,7,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,22,4,8,A-ha!
Monica Geller,Scared,1,22,7,1,"What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial."
Ethan,Joyful,1,22,7,2,I just had sex.
Monica Geller,Scared,1,22,7,3,"Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?"
Ethan,Neutral,1,22,7,4,"Well, you never told me how old you were."
Monica Geller,Scared,1,22,7,5,"Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?"
Ethan,Joyful,1,22,7,6,I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
Monica Geller,Mad,1,22,7,7,Don't say it.
Ethan,Joyful,1,22,7,8,...in love with you.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,22,7,9,Really?
Ethan,Sad,1,22,7,10,Sorry.
Monica Geller,Mad,1,22,7,11,"Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins."
Ethan,Neutral,1,22,7,12,Who?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,22,9,1,"I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,22,9,2,You were great. But they still made fun of you.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,22,9,3,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,22,9,4,"You know, now you're more like, you know like, ""Mr. Caring Boss,"" ""Mr."", you know, ""I'm one of you, Boss,"" ""Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"""
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,22,9,5,"Then, I don't get it."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,1,22,9,6,"Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,22,9,7,They do?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,22,9,8,Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,22,9,9,I just wan't to...
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,22,9,10,"No, but you can't."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,22,9,11,But I just wa...
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,22,9,12,Uh uh.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,22,10,1,Aren't you gonna...
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,22,10,2,"Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,22,10,3,What about Andre?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,22,10,4,"Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know."
Ethan,Neutral,1,22,10,6,Hey.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,22,10,7,That was gonna be my opener.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,22,10,8,"Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,22,10,9,I thought that was just a rumour.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,22,10,10,True story.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,22,10,11,They're here already?
Ethan,Joyful,1,22,10,13,"All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,22,10,14,It was.
Ethan,Neutral,1,22,10,15,"Then, what's the problem?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,22,10,16,"Ethan, it's um... it's icky."
Ethan,Scared,1,22,10,17,Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,22,10,18,"This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really..."
Ethan,Neutral,1,22,10,19,"No, don't say it."
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,22,10,20,...love you.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,22,10,22,Are you're hands still wet?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,22,10,23,"Uh, moist, yeah."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,22,10,24,Let's dry 'em again.
Gerston,Mad,1,22,11,1,"Uh, like, could these margaritas be any stronger? Hey, Chandler."
Santos,Neutral,1,22,11,2,"Hello, Mr. Bing."
Petrie,Joyful,1,22,11,3,Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,22,11,4,"Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock."
Santos,Neutral,1,22,11,5,Sure.
Gerston,Neutral,1,22,11,6,No problem.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,22,11,8,"You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,22,11,9,Petrie.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,22,11,10,"Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,1,22,12,1,"Oooooooooh. Oh, that's nice. Oh, oh. Huh, Ross!"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,1,22,12,3,Ross?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,1,22,12,4,I'm here.
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,22,12,5,"You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just... Wow!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,22,12,6,"What? Great, now I'm having a baby."
Rachel Green,Scared,1,22,12,7,What?
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,22,12,8,"Ooh, Ooh."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,22,12,9,What?
Ross Geller,Scared,1,22,12,10,I'm having... I'm having a baby. I'm having a... Where's the phone? The phone?
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,22,12,11,I don't know where the phone is.
Rachel Green,Sad,1,22,12,13,Ross?
Ross Geller,Sad,1,22,12,14,I'm hurt.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,22,13,1,"Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,22,13,3,"Hey Ross, look what I've got going here."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,22,13,4,"Yeah, save it for the cab, okay."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,22,13,6,What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.
Rachel Green,Scared,1,22,13,7,"What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there."
Ross Geller,Mad,1,22,13,8,"Joey, get out of the fridge."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,22,13,9,"All right, all right."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,22,13,10,What is that?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,22,13,11,For the ride.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,22,13,12,"Yeah, like in a cab..."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,22,13,13,Save it.
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,22,13,14,"Okay, hating this."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,22,13,15,"Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming."

Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,22,13,19,"All right, I'm going. I'm going."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,22,13,21,"Here we go, here we go."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,22,13,22,"Rossy, Rossy."
Ross Geller,Scared,1,23,1,1,She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,23,1,2,I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
Ross Geller,Scared,1,23,1,3,"I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,23,1,5,Do we have to know about that?
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,23,1,6,"Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,23,1,7,"I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,23,1,8,"Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's."
Ross Geller,Scared,1,23,1,9,"God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,23,1,10,"Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction."
Rachel Green,Powerful,1,23,1,12,"What, it's ok when Chandler does it?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,23,1,13,You have to pick your moments.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,23,1,15,"Did I miss it, did I miss it?"
Ross Geller,Scared,1,23,1,16,She's not even here yet.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,23,1,17,What's with the guitar?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,23,1,18,"I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical."
Ross Geller,Mad,1,23,1,20,Where the hell have you been?
Susan Bunch,Peaceful,1,23,1,21,We stopped at the gift shop.
Carol Willick,Peaceful,1,23,1,22,"I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky."
Ross Geller,Mad,1,23,1,23,"Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,23,1,24,I used to have that bumper sticker.
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,23,1,26,You see what I mean.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,23,2,1,Stopped for a Chunky.
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,23,2,2,"Let it go, Ross."
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,23,2,3,I got an extra one. You want this?
Ross Geller,Sad,1,23,2,4,No.
Dr. Franzblau,Joyful,1,23,2,6,"Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,23,2,7,"Dr. Franzblau, hi."
Dr. Franzblau,Joyful,1,23,2,8,"So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?"
Carol Willick,Joyful,1,23,2,9,"Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus."
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,23,2,10,They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,23,2,11,"59 seconds. Quartz, ha."
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,23,2,12,"Swiss quartz, ha, ha."
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,23,2,13,Am I allowed to drink anything?
Dr. Franzblau,Neutral,1,23,2,14,"Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station."
Ross Geller,Powerful,1,23,2,15,I'll get it.
Susan Bunch,Powerful,1,23,2,16,"No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back."
Ross Geller,Powerful,1,23,2,17,I got itI'm getting it!
Rachel Green,Peaceful,1,23,2,19,"Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips."
Carol Willick,Peaceful,1,23,2,20,Thanks.
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,23,2,21,"And if you need anything else, I do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate."
Dr. Franzblau,Joyful,1,23,2,22,It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's... brother's... ex-wife's obstetrician.
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,23,2,23,"Oh, that's funny!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,23,3,1,I want a baby.
Chandler Bing,Sad,1,23,3,2,"Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow."
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,23,3,3,Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
Chandler Bing,Sad,1,23,3,4,"Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,23,3,6,"Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too."
Lydia,Neutral,1,23,3,8,Knick fan?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,23,3,9,"Oh, yeah."
Lydia,Neutral,1,23,3,10,"Oh, boy, do they suck."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,23,3,11,"Hey, listen, lady.... ...whoa."
Lydia,Joyful,1,23,3,12,"Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice shot. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,23,3,13,Oh yeah? And who do you like?
Lydia,Powerful,1,23,3,14,The Celtics.
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,1,23,3,15,"The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?"
Lydia,Mad,1,23,3,16,"Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,23,3,17,"Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!"
Lydia,Neutral,1,23,3,18,There is no father.
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,1,23,3,19,"Oh, oh, oh, sorry."
Lydia,Scared,1,23,3,20,"Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,23,3,21,"Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here."
Lydia,Neutral,1,23,3,22,Ok.
Lydia,Mad,1,23,5,1,"Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here. What do you mean, Joey who? Joey who?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,23,5,2,Tribbiani.
Lydia,Neutral,1,23,5,3,"Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on. She wants to talk to you. Take the phone."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,23,5,4,"Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. Yeah, I'm single. 25. An actor. Hello?"
Lydia,Neutral,1,23,5,5,She's not much of a phone person.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,1,23,5,6,"Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?"
Lydia,Mad,1,23,5,7,"Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,1,23,5,8,"Ok, look, maybe I should just go."
Lydia,Neutral,1,23,5,9,Maybe you should.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,23,5,10,"Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,1,23,5,12,You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
Lydia,Mad,1,23,5,13,"Oh, that is so not true."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,23,5,14,"Oh, it is."
Lydia,Mad,1,23,5,15,It isn't.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,23,5,16,It is.
Lydia,Mad,1,23,5,17,Isn't!
Nurse Sizemore,Scared,1,23,7,1,"Breathe, breathe, breathe..."
Lydia,Scared,1,23,7,2,"Oh, no."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,23,7,4,Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
Nurse Sizemore,Neutral,1,23,7,5,"It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,23,7,6,"Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?"
Nurse Sizemore,Peaceful,1,23,7,7,"Breathe, breathe, breathe."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,23,8,1,Please. This is so your fault.
Susan Bunch,Scared,1,23,8,2,"How, how is this my fault?"
Ross Geller,Scared,1,23,8,3,"Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along."
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,23,8,4,"Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,23,8,5,You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,23,8,6,You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
Ross Geller,Mad,1,23,8,7,"Oh, I'm threatened by you?"
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,23,8,8,Yes.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,1,23,8,10,"Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,23,8,11,"Yeah, Susan."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,1,23,8,12,"Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,23,8,14,"Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?"
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,23,10,1,Are they here yet?
Rachel Green,Peaceful,1,23,10,2,"No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?"
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,23,10,3,Ok.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,23,10,4,Ok?
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,23,10,5,Ok.
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,23,10,6,"Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating."
Dr. Franzblau,Joyful,1,23,10,7,"It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear."
Dr. Franzblau,Peaceful,1,23,14,1,"I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?"
Rachel Green,Scared,1,23,14,2,"No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?"
Dr. Franzblau,Sad,1,23,14,3,"No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,23,14,4,"Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors."
Dr. Franzblau,Neutral,1,23,14,5,"No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,23,14,6,Oh.
Dr. Franzblau,Neutral,1,23,14,7,"I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,23,14,8,I'm a waitress.
Dr. Franzblau,Neutral,1,23,14,9,"Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'..."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,23,14,10,Yeah. Gotcha.
Dr. Franzblau,Neutral,1,23,14,11,I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,23,14,12,Ok. That's fine.
Lydia,Neutral,1,23,15,1,So how did you know I was even here?
Guy,Neutral,1,23,15,2,Your mom called me. So is this her?
Lydia,Neutral,1,23,15,3,"No, this is a loaner."
Guy,Sad,1,23,15,4,I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
Lydia,Neutral,1,23,15,5,"I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. So, did you see who won the game?"
Guy,Mad,1,23,15,6,"Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck."
Lydia,Neutral,1,23,15,7,"Yeah, they're not so bad."
Ross Geller,Mad,1,23,16,1,"Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you."
Susan Bunch,Joyful,1,23,16,2,The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
Ross Geller,Scared,1,23,16,3,"No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?"
Susan Bunch,Scared,1,23,16,4,"You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day."
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,23,16,5,Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,23,16,6,This is so great.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,23,16,7,You wanna explain that?
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,1,23,16,8,"I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting."
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,23,17,1,Where are they?
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,23,17,2,I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,23,17,3,"Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,23,17,4,Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,23,17,5,You are really frightening me.
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,23,17,7,"Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple?"
Dr. Franzblau,Neutral,1,23,17,8,"All right, ten centimeters, here we go."
Nurse Sizemore,Neutral,1,23,17,9,"All right, honey, time to start pushing."
Carol Willick,Scared,1,23,17,10,But they're not here yet!
Dr. Franzblau,Sad,1,23,17,11,"I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them."
Carol Willick,Scared,1,23,17,12,"Oh, god."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,23,18,1,"Ok, got the vent open."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,23,18,2,"Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,1,23,18,3,"Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben."
Susan Bunch,Joyful,1,23,18,5,What do you see?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,23,18,6,"Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent."
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,23,18,8,"Phoebs, It's open! It's open!"
Janitor,Powerful,1,23,18,10,Wait! You forgot your legs!
#ALL#,Powerful,1,23,19,1,"Push, push!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,23,19,2,We're here!
Carol Willick,Mad,1,23,19,3,Where have you been?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,1,23,19,4,"Long story, honey."
Dr. Franzblau,Powerful,1,23,19,5,"All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need Excuse me, could I have this?"
Nurse Sizemore,Joyful,1,23,19,6,"All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!"
#ALL#,Joyful,1,23,19,7,Good luck!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,23,19,9,"Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?"
Nurse Sizemore,Mad,1,23,19,10,Out!
Dr. Franzblau,Joyful,1,23,19,11,"All right, he's crowning. Here he comes."
Ross Geller,Scared,1,23,19,12,"Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?"
Carol Willick,Mad,1,23,19,13,Not.... helping!
Dr. Franzblau,Joyful,1,23,19,14,"You're doing great, you're doing fine."
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,23,19,15,"Hello! Oh, sorry."
Susan Bunch,Joyful,1,23,19,16,What do you see? What do you see?
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,23,19,17,"We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person."
Susan Bunch,Joyful,1,23,19,18,"Oh, look at that."
Carol Willick,Joyful,1,23,19,19,What does he look like?
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,23,19,20,"Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell-o."
Carol Willick,Joyful,1,23,19,21,Really?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,23,19,22,"You guys, he's beautiful!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,23,19,23,"Oh, thanks, Pheebs!"
Susan Bunch,Peaceful,1,23,20,1,"No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,1,23,20,2,How 'bout Ben?
Susan Bunch,Peaceful,1,23,20,3,I like Ben.
Carol Willick,Neutral,1,23,20,4,Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,23,20,5,"We uh, we just cooked it up."
Susan Bunch,Neutral,1,23,20,6,That's what we were off doing.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,23,20,8,Hi.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,23,20,9,Hey.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,23,20,10,Can we come in?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,1,23,20,12,"I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,23,20,13,"Susan, he looks just like you."
Susan Bunch,Peaceful,1,23,20,14,Thanks.
Rachel Green,Scared,1,23,20,15,"Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,23,20,16,"I know, I still am one of these."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,1,23,20,17,"Ross, can I?"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,1,23,20,19,"The head, the head. You gotta..."
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,23,20,20,"Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum."
Ross Geller,Joyful,1,23,21,1,"Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,23,21,3,"And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this."
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,23,21,5,He is so amazing.
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,23,21,6,"Oh, I know. Look at him."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,23,21,7,"Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,23,21,8,"Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,23,21,9,"He doesn't do much, does he?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,23,21,10,"No, this is pretty much it."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,23,21,12,You guys wanna get some coffee?
#ALL#,Neutral,1,23,21,13,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,23,21,14,"All right, I'll see you guys later."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,23,21,16,"Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,24,1,1,And here's little Ben nodding off...
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,24,1,2,"Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,24,1,3,"Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!"
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,24,1,4,"Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!"
Ross Geller,Sad,1,24,1,6,That would be nice.
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,24,1,8,Pardon?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,24,1,9,"Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,24,1,11,"Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back."
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,24,1,12,"Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,24,1,13,"I will, really. I'll pay you back this time."
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,24,1,14,... And where's this money coming from?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,24,1,15,Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,24,1,16,What kind of research?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,24,1,17,"Oh, just, y'know.... science."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,24,1,18,"Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,24,1,19,... It's a fertility study.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,24,1,21,"Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,24,1,22,"Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,24,1,23,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,24,1,24,"Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!"
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,24,3,1,"I mean, this is unbelievable."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,24,3,2,"I know. This is really, really huge."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,1,24,3,3,No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,1,24,3,4,Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,1,24,3,5,"OK, is there a mute button on this woman?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,24,3,6,"I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,24,3,7,"No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,24,3,8,"Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,24,3,9,"Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him."
Chandler Bing,Scared,1,24,3,10,H-He's in China!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,24,3,11,The country.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,24,3,12,"No, no, wait. His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,24,3,13,What about the time difference?
Monica Geller,Scared,1,24,3,14,From here to the airport?
Chandler Bing,Powerful,1,24,3,15,Yes! You're never gonna make it!
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,24,3,16,"Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?"
Rachel Green,Scared,1,24,3,17,I-I-I don't know.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,24,3,18,Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,24,3,19,"He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait."
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,24,3,20,"Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now."
Rachel Green,Scared,1,24,3,21,I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,24,3,22,"Here, look, alright, does this help?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,24,3,24,"Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,24,3,25,"Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!"
Flight Attendant,Neutral,1,24,4,2,Alright!
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,24,4,3,Ni-chou chi-ma!
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,24,4,5,"Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me...."
Flight Attendant,Neutral,1,24,4,7,Hi!
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,24,4,8,Hi.
Flight Attendant,Neutral,1,24,4,9,May I see your boarding pass?
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,24,4,10,"Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend."
Flight Attendant,Neutral,1,24,4,11,"Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,24,4,12,"No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just..."
Flight Attendant,Scared,1,24,4,13,No no no! Federal regulations!
Rachel Green,Mad,1,24,4,14,"OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important."
Flight Attendant,Scared,1,24,4,15,Alright. What's the message?
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,24,4,16,Uh... I don't know.
Flight Attendant,Sad,1,24,4,18,"Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you."
Man,Powerful,1,24,4,19,What?
Flight Attendant,Scared,1,24,4,20,"It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back."
Man,Joyful,1,24,4,21,": Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze."
Melanie,Neutral,1,24,5,1,"Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,24,5,2,"Heh, heh. It was nothin'."
Melanie,Joyful,1,24,5,3,"Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,24,5,4,"Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn."
Melanie,Joyful,1,24,5,5,M-Me again?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,24,5,6,Sure! Why not?
Melanie,Joyful,1,24,5,7,"Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow."
Melanie,Joyful,1,24,5,9,"Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,24,5,10,How do you mean?
Melanie,Joyful,1,24,5,11,"I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,1,24,6,1,"Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?"
Rachel Green,Scared,1,24,6,2,"I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross."
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,24,6,4,"I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great."
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,24,6,5,"Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,1,24,6,6,"Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date."
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,24,6,7,Another good point.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,1,24,6,8,"No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed."
Rachel Green,Scared,1,24,6,9,Huh?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,1,24,6,10,"Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?"
Monica Geller,Scared,1,24,6,11,Why isn't it working out?
Rachel Green,Scared,1,24,6,12,I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Monica Geller,Mad,1,24,6,13,Is he not cute enough for you?
Rachel Green,Sad,1,24,6,14,No!
Monica Geller,Mad,1,24,6,15,Does he not make enough money?
Rachel Green,Scared,1,24,6,16,"No, I'm just...."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,1,24,6,17,Maybe there's someone else.
Rachel Green,Joyful,1,24,6,18,Wha...
Monica Geller,Mad,1,24,6,19,Is there? Is there someone else?
Rachel Green,Scared,1,24,6,20,No! There is.. there is noone else!
Monica Geller,Scared,1,24,6,21,Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,24,7,1,"Hey, big..."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,1,24,7,2,Shhhh!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,24,7,3,...spender.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,24,7,4,She's still asleep.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,24,7,5,So how'd it go?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,24,7,6,"Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,24,7,7,The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,24,7,8,"Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!"
Chandler Bing,Mad,1,24,7,9,"Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,24,7,10,"It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,24,7,11,I didn't know you had another level.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,24,7,12,I know! Neither did I!
Monica Geller,Joyful,1,24,8,1,"Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,1,24,8,2,Yeah.
Monica Geller,Neutral,1,24,8,3,"Oh, from who?"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,1,24,8,4,From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,1,24,8,5,"Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?"
Rachel Green,Scared,1,24,8,6,"Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea."
Monica Geller,Scared,1,24,8,7,"Oh, why?"
Rachel Green,Scared,1,24,8,8,"Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna..."
Monica Geller,Scared,1,24,8,9,"No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!"
Rachel Green,Scared,1,24,8,10,"Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so..."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,1,24,8,11,"I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,24,8,13,Who is it?
Intercom,Neutral,1,24,8,14,"It's me, Carl."
Rachel Green,Neutral,1,24,8,15,C'mon up.
Monica Geller,Mad,1,24,8,16,Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,24,9,1,Seven hundred bucks!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,1,24,9,2,"Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,1,24,9,3,"Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,1,24,9,4,"Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,1,24,9,5,"What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?"
Rachel Green,Scared,1,24,11,1,"Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi."
Man,Mad,1,24,11,3,"For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!"
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,24,11,5,"Oh, hey, hey, I got that."
Julie,Neutral,1,24,11,7,"Oh, thanks, sweetie."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,24,11,8,No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Julie,Neutral,1,24,11,9,Really?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,24,11,10,Yeah.
Julie,Scared,1,24,11,11,You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,24,11,12,"No, no, they will. I just... uh..."
Ross Geller,Neutral,1,24,11,14,"Come on, they're gonna love you."
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,1,2,2,Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,1,2,3,Rach!
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,1,2,4,"Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?"
Ross Geller,Scared,2,1,2,5,"It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?"
Rachel Green,Scared,2,1,2,6,What?
Ross Geller,Scared,2,1,2,7,You're bleeding.
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,1,2,8,"I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,1,2,9,"Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,1,2,10,"These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country."
Julie,Peaceful,2,1,2,11,Thank you. I'm from New York.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,1,2,12,"Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,1,4,2,"Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,1,4,3,"Yeah, sure."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,1,4,4,Thank you.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,1,4,5,"Hey, Rach, can I get..."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,1,4,6,Did you talk to him?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,1,4,7,Not yet.
Rachel Green,Mad,2,1,4,8,"Then, no."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,1,4,9,"So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know."
Ross Geller,Mad,2,1,4,10,"I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?"
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,1,4,11,God?
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,1,4,12,"It was you, pal."
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,1,4,13,"Well, maybe it was God, doing me."
Ross Geller,Sad,2,1,4,14,"Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,2,1,4,15,"Well, you owe me one, big guy."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,1,4,16,Here's your lemonade.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,1,4,17,I didn't order lemonade.
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,1,4,18,"Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,1,4,19,But...
Rachel Green,Scared,2,1,4,20,"Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?"
Chandler Bing,Sad,2,1,4,21,"He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,1,4,22,How is that the silver lining?
Chandler Bing,Powerful,2,1,4,23,You have to really wanna see it.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,1,6,2,"You know, I think I was sixteen."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,1,6,3,"Please, just a little bit off the back."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,1,6,4,"I'm still on ""no."""
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,1,6,5,"Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,1,6,6,"No-no-no-no-no, I'm not fallin' for that again."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,1,6,7,What's goin' on?
Rachel Green,Mad,2,1,6,8,"Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,1,6,9,What stupid thing did you do?
Paulo,Powerful,2,1,6,10,Bon giorno tutti!
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,1,6,11,Ewww!
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,1,8,2,"All right, that's it, I quit."
Monica Geller,Scared,2,1,8,3,What? I didn't say anything.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,1,8,4,"Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person."
Monica Geller,Sad,2,1,8,5,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,1,8,6,Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Monica Geller,Mad,2,1,8,7,How who wears it?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,1,8,8,Demi Moore.
Monica Geller,Mad,2,1,8,9,Demi Moore is not a he.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,1,8,10,"Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,1,8,11,That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,1,8,12,Oh. Oh!
Monica Geller,Scared,2,1,8,13,Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,1,8,14,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,Scared,2,1,8,15,Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,1,8,16,"Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,1,8,17,"She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,1,8,18,"Oh, she's got gorgeous hair."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,1,8,19,I know!
Monica Geller,Mad,2,1,11,2,Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,1,11,3,"I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,1,11,4,Thank you. My hair is very amused.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,1,11,5,"Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,1,11,6,Thank you.
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,1,11,7,"Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,1,11,8,"Wait, are you leaving?"
Ross Geller,Mad,2,1,11,9,"Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by ""bye!"""
Rachel Green,Scared,2,1,11,10,"Well, can I talk to you for a sec?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,1,11,11,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,1,11,12,"Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test..."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,1,11,13,That's ok.
Ross Geller,Scared,2,1,11,14,What's goin' on?
Rachel Green,Mad,2,1,11,15,"Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?"
Ross Geller,Scared,2,1,11,16,"Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?"
Rachel Green,Powerful,2,1,11,17,No. No-no-no-no.
Ross Geller,Mad,2,1,11,18,"Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,1,11,19,Really?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,1,11,20,"You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking ""Oh my god, I'm with Rachel"". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?"
Rachel Green,Sad,2,1,11,21,"No, I think that was the whole all."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,1,11,22,Okay. Okay. Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,1,11,23,"I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants."
Julie,Neutral,2,1,12,2,"I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,1,12,3,"Oh yeah! Oh, I can do that."
Julie,Joyful,2,1,12,4,Really?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,1,12,5,You wanna do it right now?
Julie,Joyful,2,1,12,6,Great!
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,1,12,7,"Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,1,12,8,No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,1,12,9,"Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,1,12,10,You're welcome.
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,2,1,2,"Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,2,1,3,"Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?"
Susan Bunch,Neutral,2,2,1,4,"Oh, is he hungry already?"
Carol Willick,Neutral,2,2,1,5,I guess so.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,2,1,6,"You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,2,1,7,"I gotta get one, too."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,2,1,8,What are you guys doing?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,2,1,9,We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
Ross Geller,Mad,2,2,1,10,"Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,2,1,11,"Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it."
Ross Geller,Mad,2,2,1,12,"This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,2,1,13,Carol?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,2,1,14,Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
Carol Willick,Neutral,2,2,1,15,Sure.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,2,1,16,"Uh, does it hurt?"
Carol Willick,Neutral,2,2,1,17,"It did at first, but not anymore."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,2,1,18,Chandler?
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,2,1,19,"So, uh, how often can you do it?"
Carol Willick,Neutral,2,2,1,20,As much as he needs.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,2,1,21,"Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?"
Julie,Neutral,2,2,2,2,"Rachel, do you have any muffins left?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,2,2,3,"Yeah, I forget which ones."
Julie,Neutral,2,2,2,4,"Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?"
#ALL#,Neutral,2,2,2,5,No thanks.
Julie,Neutral,2,2,2,6,"Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,2,2,7,Thank you. What a bitch.
Julie,Neutral,2,2,2,8,"Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,2,2,9,"I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,2,2,10,"Ok, um, I'll go with you."
Julie,Joyful,2,2,2,11,Great.
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,2,2,12,"Hi, honey."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,2,2,13,"Hey, sweetums."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,2,2,14,Hello to the rest.
#ALL#,Joyful,2,2,2,15,Hi!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,2,2,16,Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,2,2,17,"It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,2,2,18,"Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,2,2,19,But I'm...
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,2,2,20,"Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,2,2,21,"So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,2,2,22,"Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,2,2,23,"It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,2,2,24,You're welcome.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,2,2,25,"Woof, woof."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,2,3,2,Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.
Annabelle,Neutral,2,2,3,3,"Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,2,3,4,Who?
Annabelle,Joyful,2,2,3,5,Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.
Hombre Man,Neutral,2,2,3,6,Hombre?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,2,3,7,What's he doin' in my section?
Annabelle,Neutral,2,2,3,8,I guess he doesn't know.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,2,3,9,"Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?"
Hombre Man,Neutral,2,2,3,10,Mornin'.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,2,3,11,"Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory."
Hombre Man,Mad,2,2,3,12,"Your territory, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,2,3,13,Yeah. Bijan for men?
Guy,Neutral,2,2,3,14,No thanks.
Hombre Man,Neutral,2,2,3,15,Hombre?
Guy,Joyful,2,2,3,16,Yeah. All right.
Hombre Man,Powerful,2,2,3,17,You were saying?
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,2,4,2,"Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,2,4,3,What?
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,2,4,4,"We were shopping, and we had lunch."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,2,4,5,"Oh, all right. What did I have?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,2,4,6,You had a salad.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,2,4,7,"Oh, no wonder I don't feel full."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,2,4,8,"Hey, guys, what's up."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,2,4,9,"I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,2,4,10,"Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,2,4,11,"Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,2,4,12,You went shopping for fur?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,2,4,13,"Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,2,4,14,You bought boobs?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,2,4,15,Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,2,5,2,"Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee."
Annabelle,Sad,2,2,5,3,"Oh, actually I sorta have plans."
Hombre Man,Neutral,2,2,5,4,"Ready, Annabelle?"
Annabelle,Neutral,2,2,5,5,You bet. Maybe some other time?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,2,5,6,"Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!"
Carol Willick,Joyful,2,2,6,2,"Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep."
Ross Geller,Powerful,2,2,6,3,"Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son."
Susan Bunch,Joyful,2,2,6,4,"Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person."
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,2,6,5,"Oh, this is so cute."
Susan Bunch,Joyful,2,2,6,6,"Oh, I got that for him."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,2,6,7,My mommies love me. That's clever.
Monica Geller,Powerful,2,2,6,8,"Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,2,6,9,"Did you just say Hi, Jew?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,2,6,10,"Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,2,7,2,"Ben, dinner!"
Ross Geller,Scared,2,2,7,3,"Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,2,7,4,"Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,2,7,5,What did you just do?
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,2,7,6,"I licked my arm, what?"
Ross Geller,Mad,2,2,7,7,It's breast milk.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,2,7,8,So?
Rachel Green,Powerful,2,2,7,9,"Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,2,7,10,What is the big deal?
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,2,7,11,What did you just do?
Ross Geller,Mad,2,2,7,12,"Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,2,7,13,You won't even taste it?
Ross Geller,Mad,2,2,7,14,No!
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,2,7,15,Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,2,7,16,Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Monica Geller,Sad,2,2,9,2,"Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve."
Carol Willick,Neutral,2,2,9,4,How did we do?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,2,9,5,"Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,2,9,6,I did not freak out.
Carol Willick,Neutral,2,2,9,7,Why'd you freak out?
Ross Geller,Scared,2,2,9,8,Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
Carol Willick,Mad,2,2,9,9,My breast milk is gross?
Susan Bunch,Neutral,2,2,9,10,This should be fun.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,2,9,11,"No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,2,9,12,Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
Carol Willick,Neutral,2,2,9,13,"Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,2,9,14,That would be no.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,2,9,15,Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,2,9,16,"Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh..."
Susan Bunch,Neutral,2,2,9,17,Cantaloupe juice.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,2,9,18,Exactly.
Ross Geller,Scared,2,2,9,19,You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
Susan Bunch,Neutral,2,2,9,20,Uh huh.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,2,9,21,"Oh, you've tasted it."
Susan Bunch,Neutral,2,2,9,22,"You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,2,9,23,Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,2,10,2,Howdy.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,2,10,3,"Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,2,10,4,"Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,2,10,5,"Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,2,10,6,What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,2,10,7,"I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,2,10,8,"All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?"
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,2,10,9,Yeah I guess you're right.
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,2,10,10,You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,2,10,11,I'm gonna do it.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,2,10,12,All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
Monica Geller,Sad,2,2,11,2,I don't know what else to say.
Rachel Green,Powerful,2,2,11,3,"Well that works out good, because I'm not listening."
Monica Geller,Sad,2,2,11,4,"I feel terrible, I really do."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,2,11,5,"Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?"
Monica Geller,Scared,2,2,11,6,"Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,2,11,7,Yes.
Monica Geller,Scared,2,2,11,8,It's that terrible?
Rachel Green,Sad,2,2,11,9,"Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you."
Monica Geller,Scared,2,2,11,10,"Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,2,11,11,I love you too.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,2,11,12,"You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that."
Monica Geller,Scared,2,2,11,13,"Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,2,11,14,"I'd do anything for you, you know that."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,2,2,11,15,I'd do anything for you.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,2,11,16,"Wait, wait, wait, wait!"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,2,12,2,"Mornin'. I said, mornin'."
Hombre Man,Neutral,2,2,12,3,I heard ya.
Store Guy,Neutral,2,2,12,4,"All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?"
Hombre Man,Neutral,2,2,12,5,Ready.
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,2,12,6,"Yeah, I'm ready."
Customer,Mad,2,2,12,7,"You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!"
Store Guy,Mad,2,2,12,8,"Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?"
Hombre Man,Scared,2,2,12,9,"I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry."
Annabelle,Scared,2,2,12,10,"My god, what happened?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,2,12,11,"These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?"
Annabelle,Neutral,2,2,12,12,Sure.
Julie,Neutral,2,2,13,2,So.
Rachel Green,Scared,2,2,13,3,"So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?"
Julie,Scared,2,2,13,4,"I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,2,13,5,Really? Me?
Julie,Sad,2,2,13,6,"Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,2,13,7,"Well, you're not totally paranoid."
Julie,Sad,2,2,13,8,Oy.
Rachel Green,Sad,2,2,13,9,"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right."
Julie,Peaceful,2,2,13,10,"Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,2,13,11,"Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it."
Julie,Neutral,2,2,13,12,"I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,2,13,13,"All right, Julie."
Julie,Neutral,2,2,13,14,Bye.
Rachel Green,Mad,2,2,13,15,Bye. What a manipulative bitch.
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,3,2,1,Mr. Heckles.
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,3,2,2,How did this happen?
Mr. Treeger,Sad,2,3,2,3,He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.
Monica Geller,Sad,2,3,2,4,That's terrible.
Mr. Treeger,Sad,2,3,2,5,I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.
Ross Geller,Sad,2,3,2,6,"Sure, sweepin'. You never know."
Mr. Treeger,Sad,2,3,2,7,You never know.
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,3,2,8,"Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,3,2,9,"Ok, Phoebe."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,3,2,10,"I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,3,2,11,Such as?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,3,2,12,"Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?"
Ross Geller,Scared,2,3,2,13,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,3,2,14,Nah. Not really.
Ross Geller,Scared,2,3,2,15,You don't believe in evolution?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,3,2,16,"I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy."
Ross Geller,Mad,2,3,2,17,"Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,3,2,18,"Yeah, I just don't buy it."
Ross Geller,Mad,2,3,2,19,"Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,3,2,20,"Ok, don't get me started on gravity."
Ross Geller,Mad,2,3,2,21,"You uh, you don't believe in gravity?"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,3,2,22,"Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,3,2,23,"Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed."
Mr. Treeger,Joyful,2,3,3,1,"There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,3,3,2,What can we do for you?
Buddy Boyles,Peaceful,2,3,3,3,"All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to ""the noisy girls in the apartment above mine""."
Monica Geller,Sad,2,3,3,4,"Well, what about his family?"
Buddy Boyles,Powerful,2,3,3,5,He didn't have any.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,3,3,6,"Ok, so let's talk money."
Buddy Boyles,Powerful,2,3,3,7,"All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,3,5,1,How can you not believe in evolution?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,3,5,2,Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
Ross Geller,Scared,2,3,5,3,"Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,3,5,4,Really? You can actually see it?
Ross Geller,Powerful,2,3,5,5,"You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,3,5,6,"See, I didn't know that."
Ross Geller,Powerful,2,3,5,7,"Well, there you go."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,3,5,8,"Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,3,6,1,"Hey, look at this. ""My Big Book of Grievances."""
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,3,6,2,"Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,2,3,6,3,"April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent."
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,3,6,4,"Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,3,6,5,"Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps."
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,3,6,6,"What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,3,6,7,It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
Rachel Green,Mad,2,3,6,8,"Well, what about my stuff?"
Monica Geller,Powerful,2,3,6,9,You don't have any stuff.
Rachel Green,Mad,2,3,6,10,"You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,3,6,11,No.
Rachel Green,Mad,2,3,6,12,"Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,3,6,13,Mmmmm.
Rachel Green,Powerful,2,3,6,14,"Ok, while you ""mmm"" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,3,7,1,"Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,3,7,2,Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
Ross Geller,Mad,2,3,7,3,Please tell me you're joking.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,3,7,4,"Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't."
Ross Geller,Mad,2,3,7,5,"No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--"
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,3,7,6,"What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,3,7,7,Is there blood coming out of my ears?
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,3,9,1,"Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,3,9,2,What?
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,3,9,3,Hide the Lamp.
Rachel Green,Mad,2,3,9,4,"Monica, let it go."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,3,9,5,Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
Rachel Green,Mad,2,3,9,6,"Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,3,10,1,Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,3,10,2,"Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,3,10,3,"Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities."
Ross Geller,Mad,2,3,10,4,"It's the only possibility, Phoebe."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,3,10,5,"Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,3,10,6,"There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,3,10,7,I can't believe you caved.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,3,10,8,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,3,10,9,"You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?"
Rachel Green,Mad,2,4,1,2,"Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. It's open you guys."
Stranger,Neutral,2,4,1,3,Hi.
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,4,1,4,"Hi, hi can I help you?"
Stranger,Neutral,2,4,1,5,"Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,4,1,6,"Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her."
Stranger,Powerful,2,4,1,7,"Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,4,1,8,What?
Stranger,Scared,2,4,1,9,"Hey, how, how did you do that?"
Ross Geller,Scared,2,4,3,2,"So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,4,3,3,"Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia."
Julie,Powerful,2,4,3,4,"You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,4,3,5,"Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,4,3,6,"You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?"
Rachel Green,Mad,2,4,3,7,"Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,4,3,8,"Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,4,3,9,"Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it."
#ALL#,Joyful,2,4,3,10,Woah.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,4,3,11,Foxy lady.
Julie,Neutral,2,4,3,12,Where you goin'?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,4,3,13,"Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,4,3,14,The Ice Capades?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,4,3,15,"No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,4,3,16,"I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,4,3,17,"OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,4,3,18,"Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,4,3,19,"Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . ."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,4,5,2,Hi.
Duncan,Neutral,2,4,5,3,Phoebe!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,4,5,4,Ta-da.
Duncan,Joyful,2,4,5,5,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,4,5,6,Hi.
Duncan,Peaceful,2,4,5,7,"Ahh, look at you, you look great."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,4,5,8,"Do I? Thank you, so do you."
Duncan,Powerful,2,4,5,9,Thanks.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,4,5,10,"Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice."
Duncan,Peaceful,2,4,5,11,You always said I'd make it.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,4,5,12,"Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo."
Duncan,Peaceful,2,4,5,13,I missed you. I'm gonna get changed.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,4,5,14,OK.
Duncan,Neutral,2,4,5,15,"Um, now. Phoebs."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,4,5,16,"Oh, right, OK. Ole."
Duncan,Scared,2,4,5,17,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,4,5,18,"Um, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,4,6,2,"Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,4,6,3,"Uh, Julie."
Julie,Neutral,2,4,6,4,Yeah?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,4,6,5,"Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,4,6,6,Hi everyone.
#ALL#,Neutral,2,4,6,7,Hi.
Ross Geller,Scared,2,4,6,8,"I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,4,6,9,"Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,4,6,10,"Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,4,6,11,"What did, what did he say?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,4,6,12,"Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . ."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,4,7,2,What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,4,7,3,Pop it in.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,4,7,4,"I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,4,7,5,"Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,4,7,6,What's wrong with people having sex?
Rachel Green,Mad,2,4,7,7,"Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,4,7,8,"Hell, I wanna see Joey."
Julie,Scared,2,4,7,9,"So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,4,7,10,"OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,4,7,11,"All I say is, she better get the job."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,4,7,12,Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,4,7,13,"Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,4,7,14,Nice work my friend.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,4,7,15,"Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . ."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,4,8,2,"So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday."
Duncan,Scared,2,4,8,3,"Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,4,8,4,Ohh. . .K. How come?
Duncan,Scared,2,4,8,5,"Umm, actually, I'm getting married again."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,4,8,6,What?
Duncan,Scared,2,4,8,7,"Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,4,8,8,Huuh.
Duncan,Scared,2,4,8,9,"Yeah, I know, I."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,4,8,10,"I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties."
Duncan,Peaceful,2,4,8,11,"I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,4,8,12,So how long have you known?
Duncan,Neutral,2,4,8,13,"Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,4,8,14,"And um, and there's actually a, a woman?"
Duncan,Powerful,2,4,8,15,Her name's Debra.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,4,8,16,"Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?"
Duncan,Scared,2,4,8,17,"Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,4,8,18,Sure.
Duncan,Powerful,2,4,8,19,"But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,4,8,20,"I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'"
Duncan,Powerful,2,4,8,21,"I'm, I'm still me."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,4,8,22,Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
Monica Geller,Scared,2,4,9,2,"You know, it still smells like monkey in there."
Julie,Neutral,2,4,9,3,That saves us a conversation.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,4,9,4,"Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,4,9,5,"Me too, we should get goin'."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,4,9,6,"No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,4,9,7,"Rachel, that's all we do."
Rachel Green,Powerful,2,4,9,8,"Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?"
Julie,Scared,2,4,9,9,What about Julie?
Rachel Green,Scared,2,4,9,10,"Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything."
Julie,Joyful,2,4,9,11,"Well, that could take a while."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,4,9,12,"So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,4,9,13,I got the time to get to know Julie.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,4,9,14,I got time.
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,4,9,15,"Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine."
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,4,9,16,"OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?"
Julie,Neutral,2,4,9,17,"Well, in a nutshell. . ."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,4,9,18,"Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,4,10,2,"So, um, have you told your parents?"
Duncan,Peaceful,2,4,10,3,"No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . ."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,4,10,4,"Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink either answer would make me feel better."
Duncan,Joyful,2,4,10,5,I love you Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,4,10,6,So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
Ross Geller,Sad,2,5,1,2,"Man, I sure miss Julie."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,5,1,3,"Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,5,1,4,You ever figure out what that thing's for?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,5,1,5,"No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,5,1,6,"Here comes the beep, you know what to do."
Jade,Peaceful,2,5,1,7,"Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,5,1,8,What?
Jade,Joyful,2,5,1,9,I got a little drunk...and naked.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,5,1,10,Bob here.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,5,1,11,What've you been up to?
Jade,Joyful,2,5,1,12,"Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,5,1,13,Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,5,1,14,I know.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,5,1,15,I'm back.
Jade,Peaceful,2,5,1,16,"So, are we gonna get together or what?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,5,1,17,"Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?"
Jade,Joyful,2,5,1,18,"Great, I'll see you then."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,5,1,19,Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,5,1,20,"Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, ""hey, you're not Bob."""
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,5,1,21,"I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,5,1,22,Oh my god. You are pure evil.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,5,1,23,"Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this."
Monica Geller,Sad,2,5,5,2,You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
Ross Geller,Sad,2,5,5,3,"Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,5,5,4,"So, let's go."
Ross Geller,Sad,2,5,5,5,"Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song."
Chandler Bing,Sad,2,5,5,6,"Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,5,5,7,"You know, the guys are probably having a great time."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,5,6,2,"Come on you guys, one more time."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,5,6,3,Ok. One.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,5,6,4,Nooo.
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,5,6,5,That was amazing!
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,5,6,6,"Excellent, that was excellent."
Chandler Bing,Sad,2,5,6,7,I can't believe the guys missed this.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,5,6,8,"What guys? Oh, yeah."
Steven Fisher,Neutral,2,5,6,9,"Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,5,6,10,Do I know you?
Steven Fisher,Neutral,2,5,6,11,You used to be my babysitter.
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,5,6,12,"Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?"
Steven Fisher,Joyful,2,5,6,13,"Good, good, I'm a lawyer now."
Monica Geller,Sad,2,5,6,14,You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
Steven Fisher,Joyful,2,5,6,15,"Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,5,6,16,"Uh, wait, backstage?"
Steven Fisher,Neutral,2,5,6,17,"Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,5,6,18,Ross.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,5,6,19,Chandler.
Steven Fisher,Joyful,2,5,6,20,"How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,6,2,2,"Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,6,2,3,Ok.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,6,2,4,"I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget."
Terry,Neutral,2,6,2,5,"Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?"
Rachel Green,Powerful,2,6,2,6,What's up?
Terry,Neutral,2,6,2,7,F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
Rachel Green,Mad,2,6,2,8,But what about Phoebe?
Terry,Neutral,2,6,2,9,"Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,6,2,10,"Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her."
Terry,Scared,2,6,2,11,Uh--
Rachel Green,Mad,2,6,2,12,"Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,6,2,13,"Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed."
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,6,3,2,"You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,6,3,3,"It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,6,3,4,"No, I got him."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,6,3,5,"No, seriously."
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,6,3,6,"Oh, seriously you want him?"
Caroline,Neutral,2,6,3,7,Hello.
Caroline,Joyful,2,6,3,9,And who is this little cutie pie?
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,6,3,10,"Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,6,3,11,You wanna smell him?
Caroline,Peaceful,2,6,3,12,I assume we're talking about the baby now.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,6,3,13,"Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head."
Caroline,Joyful,2,6,3,14,I think my uterus just skipped a beat.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,6,3,15,What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
Caroline,Joyful,2,6,3,16,I think it's great you guys are doing this.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,2,6,3,17,"Well, we are great guys."
Caroline,Peaceful,2,6,3,18,"You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,6,5,2,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,6,5,3,"Oh, hi."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,6,5,4,Here. I thought you might be cold.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,6,5,5,Thank you.
Rachel Green,Powerful,2,6,5,6,"Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,6,5,7,"Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,6,5,8,Do you?
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,6,5,9,"No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang ""Su-Su-Suicide"", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, ""Smelly Cat"", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,6,5,10,"Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,6,5,11,"It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,6,5,12,"Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for ""Smelly Cat""."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,6,5,13,Really? From who?
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,6,5,14,"Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite."
Kid,Scared,2,6,5,15,"Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,6,5,16,Yeah. Here you go.
Kid,Joyful,2,6,5,17,"Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!"
Chandler Bing,Sad,2,7,1,2,"OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,7,1,3,"So, how was the party?"
Chandler Bing,Sad,2,7,1,4,"Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,7,1,5,"No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting."
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,7,1,6,"Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,7,1,7,"No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation."
Monica Geller,Powerful,2,7,1,8,"Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you."
Chandler Bing,Sad,2,7,1,9,"Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,7,1,10,Please.
#ALL#,Neutral,2,7,1,11,C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,7,1,12,"Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,7,1,13,"Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, can't make.... hands... meet...."
Michael,Scared,2,7,5,2,"I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,7,5,3,How long do cats live?
Michael,Neutral,2,7,5,4,I'm sorry?
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,7,5,5,"Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?"
Michael,Neutral,2,7,5,6,"Um, maybe 15, 16 years."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,7,5,7,That's just great.
Michael,Joyful,2,7,5,8,"Um, cheers."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,7,5,9,"Oh, right, clink."
Michael,Sad,2,7,5,10,"Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?"
Rachel Green,Sad,2,7,5,11,"Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend."
Michael,Neutral,2,7,5,12,"Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,7,5,13,I mean he just started going out with her.
Michael,Neutral,2,7,5,14,"Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,7,5,15,"Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you."
Michael,Neutral,2,7,5,16,Alright.
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,7,5,17,"OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,7,6,2,"So, I figured it out."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,7,6,3,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,7,6,4,Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,7,6,5,"Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, ""Excellent butt, great rack."""
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,7,6,6,"Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,7,6,7,"Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,7,6,8,"You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,7,7,2,"I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?"
Michael,Neutral,2,7,7,3,Fruitflies?
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,7,7,4,Yes! Thank you.
Waiter,Neutral,2,7,7,5,"So, would you like any dessert?"
Michael,Peaceful,2,7,7,6,"No! No dessert, just a check, please."
Rachel Green,Sad,2,7,7,7,"Oh, you're not having fun, are you?"
Michael,Sad,2,7,7,8,"No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head."
Rachel Green,Sad,2,7,7,9,"Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?"
Michael,Sad,2,7,7,10,"Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure."
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,7,7,11,"Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?"
Michael,Neutral,2,7,7,12,"Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, ""I'm over you."""
Rachel Green,Powerful,2,7,7,13,"Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo"
Guy,Neutral,2,7,7,14,Hang on.
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,7,7,15,"Hello, excuse me."
Guy,Scared,2,7,7,16,What.
Rachel Green,Powerful,2,7,7,17,"Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute."
Guy,Mad,2,7,7,18,I'm talkin'!
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,7,7,19,"I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself. OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone."
Guy,Neutral,2,7,7,20,"Alright, fine. I'll call you back."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,7,7,21,Thank you. OK. Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
Michael,Neutral,2,7,7,22,Good.
Rachel Green,Mad,2,7,7,23,"Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,7,8,2,"No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,7,8,3,Why not?
Chandler Bing,Powerful,2,7,8,4,Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,7,8,5,"OK, if you say stop, then we stop."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,2,7,8,6,"OK, stop."
Monica Geller,Powerful,2,7,8,7,"No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo Woo."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,7,10,2,Hey Joey.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,7,10,3,Hey Phoebs.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,7,10,4,How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,7,10,5,I can't find the remote. Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,7,10,6,"So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,7,10,7,And?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,7,10,8,And we did.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,7,10,9,"All right Phoebs, way to go."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,7,10,10,Yay me.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,7,10,11,"So, so how did it happen?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,7,10,12,"Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,7,10,13,And what did he say?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,7,10,14,"He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,7,10,15,Wow.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,7,10,16,"Yeah, so I said, ""OK, relax please,"" y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,7,10,17,"Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,7,10,18,Um-hum.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,7,10,19,This man is my God.
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,7,11,2,Hi.
Ross Geller,Sad,2,7,11,3,I didn't get a cat.
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,7,11,4,"Oh, that's um, interesting."
Ross Geller,Mad,2,7,11,5,"No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,7,11,6,"Alright, I got it Ross."
Ross Geller,Sad,2,7,11,7,You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Rachel Green,Sad,2,7,11,8,What?
Ross Geller,Mad,2,7,11,9,I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Rachel Green,Mad,2,7,11,10,"Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?"
Ross Geller,Mad,2,7,11,11,Then you should have said something before I met her.
Rachel Green,Mad,2,7,11,12,I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
Ross Geller,Sad,2,7,11,13,There was never a good time.
Rachel Green,Sad,2,7,11,14,"Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night."
Ross Geller,Sad,2,7,11,15,"Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,7,11,16,"Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?"
Ross Geller,Mad,2,7,11,17,"The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,7,11,18,"Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?"
Ross Geller,Mad,2,7,11,19,"Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,7,11,20,"Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross."
Ross Geller,Mad,2,7,11,21,Fine.
Rachel Green,Mad,2,7,11,22,'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Ross Geller,Mad,2,7,11,23,Good.
Rachel Green,Mad,2,7,11,24,Good.
Rachel Green,Mad,2,7,11,25,"And ya know what, now I've got closure."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,7,11,26,Try the bottom one.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,2,7,12,2,"Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over."
Monica Geller,Powerful,2,7,12,3,"No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,7,12,4,"OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,7,12,5,"Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,7,12,6,"Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,7,12,7,"Well, thanks."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,7,12,8,"I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,7,12,9,"Well, you know."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,7,12,10,"You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed."
Monica Geller,Sad,2,7,12,11,Uh-huh.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,7,12,12,And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
Monica Geller,Sad,2,7,12,13,"Well no, but um."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,7,12,14,"I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all."
Monica Geller,Sad,2,7,12,15,"Y'know, I try to stay positive. . ."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,7,12,16,"So, you feel like goin' for a run?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,7,12,17,Alright.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,7,12,18,"Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,7,12,19,OK. Just for a little while.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,7,12,20,OK.
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,8,1,2,Ross kissed me.
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,8,1,3,"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!"
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,8,1,4,It was unbelievable!
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,8,1,5,"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,8,1,6,"Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,8,1,7,"Oh, it ended very well."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,8,1,8,Oh.
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,8,1,9,Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,8,1,10,"Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a ""I gotta have you now"" kind of thing?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,8,1,11,"Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,8,1,12,"Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,8,1,13,"No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair."
Mr. Ratstatter,Joyful,2,8,4,2,"This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,8,4,3,"So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear."
Mr. Ratstatter,Neutral,2,8,4,4,Mockolate.
Monica Geller,Scared,2,8,4,5,I'm sorry?
Mr. Ratstatter,Neutral,2,8,4,6,Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.
Monica Geller,Scared,2,8,4,7,Ohh.
Mr. Ratstatter,Powerful,2,8,4,8,"Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,8,4,9,All right. Mmm-mmm.
Mr. Ratstatter,Neutral,2,8,4,10,Yeah?
Monica Geller,Mad,2,8,4,11,"I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that."
Mr. Ratstatter,Powerful,2,8,4,12,"No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,8,4,13,Mmm-mmm.
Mr. Ratstatter,Powerful,2,8,4,14,"But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,8,4,15,Wow.
Mr. Ratstatter,Neutral,2,8,4,16,Aren't you going to swallow that?
Monica Geller,Mad,2,8,4,17,Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
Mr. Ratstatter,Powerful,2,8,4,18,"Yeah, isn't that great?"
Monica Geller,Mad,2,8,4,19,Mmm.
Mr. Ratstatter,Powerful,2,8,4,20,"Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,8,4,21,"Abso... ...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate."
Mr. Ratstatter,Powerful,2,8,4,22,Really?
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,8,4,23,"Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,8,5,2,How about Mockolate mousse?
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,8,5,3,"It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,8,5,4,"Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,8,5,5,What makes it pilgrim?
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,8,5,6,We'll put buckles on it.
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,8,5,7,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,8,5,8,Hey.
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,8,5,9,Hey.
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,8,5,10,"Did uh, Ross call?"
Monica Geller,Sad,2,8,5,11,"No, I'm sorry."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,8,5,12,"Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, ""Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."""
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,8,5,13,"No offense, but that sounds nothing like her."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,8,6,2,"I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,8,6,3,"Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,8,6,4,"Hey, here's a thought, Ross."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,8,6,5,Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,8,6,6,"Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,8,6,7,"Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,8,6,8,Can't we just use a pen?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,8,6,9,"No, Amish boy."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,8,6,10,"Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,8,6,11,"I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,8,6,12,You could say that.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,8,6,13,"And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,8,6,14,Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,8,6,15,I don't know.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,8,6,16,"Oh, her ankles are a little chubby."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,8,6,17,"Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?"
Ross Geller,Sad,2,8,6,18,She's not Rachel.
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,8,7,2,"Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,8,7,3,Oh my god.
Monica Geller,Scared,2,8,7,4,Oh my god good?
Rachel Green,Mad,2,8,7,5,"Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,8,7,6,"Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,8,9,2,"My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary."
Monica Geller,Powerful,2,8,9,3,"You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,8,9,4,I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,8,9,5,"Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,8,9,6,What?
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,8,9,7,What?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,8,9,8,"Oh good, I was hoping that would come up."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,8,9,9,This was your idea?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,8,9,10,What were you thinking?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,8,9,11,"All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,8,9,12,Yeah. You!
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,8,9,13,"All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,8,9,14,"Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,8,10,2,"Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!"
Rachel Green,Mad,2,8,10,3,"When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,8,10,4,I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
Rachel Green,Mad,2,8,10,5,Not interested.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,8,10,6,"Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,8,10,7,Number six: the way you smell.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,8,10,8,"Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,8,10,9,"Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,8,10,10,"Oh, yeah, I do."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,8,10,11,What are you doing out there?
Ross Geller,Scared,2,8,10,12,"I am, uh, I am..."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,2,8,10,13,"Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?"
Ross Geller,Scared,2,8,10,14,"Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,8,10,15,No.
Ross Geller,Scared,2,8,10,16,No?
Rachel Green,Mad,2,8,10,17,That's what I said.
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,8,10,18,"Look, maybe we should go?"
Rachel Green,Mad,2,8,10,19,"No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,8,10,20,"Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel."
Rachel Green,Sad,2,8,10,21,"No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,8,10,22,"No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things."
Rachel Green,Sad,2,8,10,23,"Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said don't go!"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,8,10,24,"You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,8,10,25,"Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,8,10,26,"I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,8,11,2,"Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate."
Mr. Ratstatter,Neutral,2,8,11,3,Doesn't matter.
Monica Geller,Scared,2,8,11,4,What?
Mr. Ratstatter,Sad,2,8,11,5,Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.
Monica Geller,Sad,2,8,11,6,"Oh, gosh, I'm sorry."
Mr. Ratstatter,Sad,2,8,11,7,"Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?"
Monica Geller,Scared,2,8,11,8,"Well, uh, I ate some."
Mr. Ratstatter,Neutral,2,8,11,9,"Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,8,12,3,Hello?
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,8,12,4,Hi.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,8,12,5,"Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,8,12,6,"Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,8,12,7,"Look, can, can you do something for me?"
Monica Geller,Powerful,2,8,12,8,"Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music?"
Radio,Powerful,2,8,12,9,"The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him."
Radio,Joyful,2,8,12,10,"Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out."
Mr. Ratstatter,Neutral,2,8,13,2,"Hi, thanks for coming in again."
Monica Geller,Sad,2,8,13,3,"Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash."
Mr. Ratstatter,Neutral,2,8,13,4,"It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called ""fishtachios"". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?"
Monica Geller,Sad,2,8,13,5,Cat hair.
Mr. Ratstatter,Sad,2,8,13,6,"Oh, sorry."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,9,1,2,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,9,1,3,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,9,1,4,Hey.
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,9,1,5,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,9,1,6,"Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,9,1,7,"Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,9,1,8,"Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,9,1,9,And twenty-five it is.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,9,1,10,You gave him cookies?
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,9,1,11,"Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,9,1,12,I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,9,1,13,"Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,9,1,14,"Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,9,1,15,"So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,9,1,16,"Uhh, the mailman, the super."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,2,9,1,17,"Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,9,1,18,Oh my God.
Rachel Green,Scared,2,9,1,19,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,9,1,20,"Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,9,1,21,"Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,9,1,22,"Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle."
Ross Geller,Mad,2,9,1,23,"Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme."
Grandmother,Neutral,2,9,3,2,Esther Livingston. Gone.
Grandmother,Neutral,2,9,3,3,"Hi, Phoe."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,9,3,4,Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
Grandmother,Neutral,2,9,3,5,"Oh, just updating the phonebook."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,9,3,6,"Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?"
Grandmother,Scared,2,9,3,7,"Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,9,3,8,"Just, you know, to see... um."
Grandmother,Joyful,2,9,3,9,"Oh, sure, yeah. This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,9,3,10,"OK, is this really my father?"
Grandmother,Scared,2,9,3,11,Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,9,3,12,"OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire."
Grandmother,Scared,2,9,3,13,"Look, I. . ."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,9,3,14,"Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me."
Grandmother,Sad,2,9,3,15,"Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,9,3,16,Oh God.
Grandmother,Sad,2,9,3,17,"It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,9,3,18,"Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?"
Grandmother,Neutral,2,9,3,19,"Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,9,3,20,"OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?"
Grandmother,Neutral,2,9,3,21,Honey.
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,9,3,22,Oh.
Grandmother,Sad,2,9,3,23,"Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. This is the real him."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,9,3,24,Oh.
Chandler Bing,Sad,2,9,4,2,"Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up."
Rachel Green,Sad,2,9,4,3,"Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,9,4,4,Who said anything about Christmas?
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,9,4,5,Hi.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,9,4,6,"Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,9,4,7,"No, nothin'."
Monica Geller,Scared,2,9,4,8,I hope she's OK.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,9,4,9,"Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through."
Monica Geller,Sad,2,9,4,10,How do you know exactly what she's going through?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,9,4,11,She told us.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,9,4,12,So whaddya got there Monica?
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,9,4,13,Just some stuff for the party.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,9,4,14,"Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,9,4,15,"You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,9,4,16,Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,9,4,17,"Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,9,4,18,"Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,9,4,19,"Monica, pigeons learn faster that you."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,9,4,20,"Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,9,4,21,"Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . ."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,9,4,22,C'mon Rachel.
Rachel Green,Mad,2,9,4,23,"OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,9,4,24,"See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said."
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,9,4,25,"Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,9,5,2,"Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information."
Grandmother,Neutral,2,9,5,3,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,9,5,4,"Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name."
Grandmother,Peaceful,2,9,5,5,"C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,9,5,6,"Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math."
Grandmother,Scared,2,9,5,7,"Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,9,5,8,"No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know."
Grandmother,Sad,2,9,5,9,"I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,9,5,10,Whattaya mean?
Grandmother,Powerful,2,9,5,11,"He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,9,5,12,Wow. Thank you.
Grandmother,Neutral,2,9,5,13,"Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,9,5,14,"Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! Commercial"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,9,6,2,Phoebe here with the cab yet?
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,9,6,3,"Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,9,6,4,"Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7."
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,9,6,5,"Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,9,6,6,"Hey, here she comes."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,9,6,7,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,9,6,8,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,9,6,9,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,9,6,10,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,9,6,11,"Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,9,6,12,Eeeshk.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,9,6,13,"Yeah, big stuff."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,9,6,14,"OK, let's go."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,9,6,15,OK.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,9,6,16,"Alright, here, you have to hold this."
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,9,6,17,"OK. Brake left, gas right?"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,9,6,18,"Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet."
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,9,6,19,Where's my seat belt?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,9,6,20,"Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it."
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,9,6,21,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,9,6,22,Hey.
Ross Geller,Scared,2,9,7,2,"C'mon, just tell me, please, please."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,9,7,3,"For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,9,7,4,"Oh, gosh, it's hot in here."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,2,9,7,5,"Rach, get the heat. Ross, could you turn the heat down please?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,9,7,6,"Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . ."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,9,7,7,"Ross, the heat!"
Ross Geller,Scared,2,9,7,8,"Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. . . off."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,9,7,9,Did you just break the radiator?
Ross Geller,Scared,2,9,7,10,"No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,9,7,11,Well put it back.
Ross Geller,Scared,2,9,7,12,"It uhh, it won't go back."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,9,7,13,I'll call the super.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,2,9,7,14,"Here, let me try."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,9,7,15,"Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,9,7,16,"Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,9,7,17,"Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,9,7,18,"OK, tip the man."
Monica Geller,Sad,2,9,7,19,"No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,9,7,20,"Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,9,8,2,"Ooh, this is it, 74."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,9,8,3,"Oh, so that's what this is for."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,9,8,4,"Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,9,8,5,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,9,8,6,Sure is.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,9,8,7,"OK, here I go. I'm goin' in."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,9,8,8,Alright.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,9,8,9,Good luck Phoebs.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,9,8,10,"OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,9,10,2,OK.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,9,10,3,How far'd ya get?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,9,10,4,Mailbox.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,9,10,5,"Alright, we're gettin' closer."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,9,10,6,Uh-huh.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,9,10,7,"Phoebs, what's goin' on?"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,9,10,8,"No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . ."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,9,10,9,"Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,9,10,10,"Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,9,10,11,"Well, so why not go knock?"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,9,10,12,"Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,9,10,13,"Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,9,10,14,Yeah?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,9,10,15,"Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,9,10,16,"Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,9,10,17,You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,9,10,18,"Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,9,10,19,"Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas."
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,9,11,2,"Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,9,11,3,"Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?"
Monica Geller,Sad,2,9,11,4,"Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,9,11,5,"Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,9,11,6,"Oh, I couldn't go in."
Monica Geller,Powerful,2,9,11,7,"Honey, I'm sorry."
Ross Geller,Sad,2,9,11,8,Are you OK?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,9,11,9,"Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,9,11,10,"Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,9,11,11,"Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,9,12,2,"Rach, these are for you."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,9,12,3,Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,9,12,4,"No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,9,12,5,"OK, Phoebs, your turn."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,9,12,6,"Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,9,12,7,Uh-huh.
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,9,12,8,You guuuyys.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,9,12,9,"And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,9,12,10,You got me a cola drink?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,9,12,11,"And, a lemon lime."
Ross Geller,Mad,2,9,12,12,"Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,9,12,13,And last but not least.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,9,12,14,They're ribbed for your pleasure.
Estelle Leonard,Neutral,2,10,3,2,"Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later."
Estelle Leonard,Joyful,2,10,3,3,"Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,10,3,4,"Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday."
Estelle Leonard,Neutral,2,10,3,5,"Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,10,3,6,No.
Estelle Leonard,Joyful,2,10,3,7,"Well, here it is."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,10,3,8,"OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady..."
Estelle Leonard,Peaceful,2,10,3,9,"Oh, isn't Lori a doll?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,10,3,10,"Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in."
Estelle Leonard,Neutral,2,10,3,11,"Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,10,5,2,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,10,5,3,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Sad,2,10,5,4,"Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,10,5,5,"Well, the part's mine if I want it."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,10,5,6,Oh my God!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,10,5,7,"Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady."
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,10,5,8,Oh my... God?
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,10,5,9,"Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,10,5,10,"So, what're you gonna do?"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,10,5,11,"Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,10,5,12,"Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,10,5,13,I've never slept with someone for a part.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,10,5,14,Well is she...
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,10,5,15,Sorry.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,10,5,16,It's alright. Is she good-looking?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,10,5,17,"Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,10,5,18,"Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,10,5,19,"I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,10,5,20,Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,10,5,21,"Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it."
Waiter,Neutral,2,10,6,2,Can I get you something from the bar?
Monica Geller,Sad,2,10,6,3,"Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you."
Bobby Rush,Neutral,2,10,6,4,"If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it."
Monica Geller,Sad,2,10,6,5,"No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water."
Bobby Rush,Neutral,2,10,6,6,So the light went out in my refrigerator...
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,10,6,7,I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
Russ,Neutral,2,10,9,2,Hi.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,10,9,3,"Oh, hey."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,10,9,4,Hi.
Russ,Sad,2,10,9,5,"I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,10,9,6,"Yeah, I'm sorry man."
Russ,Neutral,2,10,9,7,"Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,10,9,8,"Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him."
Russ,Neutral,2,10,9,9,Oh.
Julie,Neutral,2,10,9,10,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,10,9,11,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,10,9,12,"Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?"
Julie,Neutral,2,10,9,13,"Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um...."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,11,1,2,"Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!"
Carol Willick,Neutral,2,11,1,3,So how did everything go?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,11,1,4,"Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it."
Carol Willick,Peaceful,2,11,1,5,"Well, we've gotta go."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,11,1,6,Ok.
Carol Willick,Neutral,2,11,1,8,"Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,11,1,9,"Oh, you and me?"
Carol Willick,Neutral,2,11,1,10,"Uh, no, Susan and me."
Susan Bunch,Neutral,2,11,1,11,The other us.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,11,1,12,Ok.
Carol Willick,Neutral,2,11,1,13,"We're uh, we're getting married."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,11,1,14,"As in, ""I now pronounce you wife and wife"" married?"
Carol Willick,Neutral,2,11,1,15,"Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,11,1,16,Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
Carol Willick,Neutral,2,11,1,17,Look I just thought that...
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,11,1,18,"No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!"
Susan Bunch,Mad,2,11,1,19,Is your finger caught in that chair?
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,11,1,20,Mmm hmmm.
Carol Willick,Neutral,2,11,1,21,Want us to go?
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,11,1,22,Uh-huh.
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,11,3,2,That is so good! Do it again!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,11,3,3,"All right, all right. ""Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"""
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,11,3,4,"That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,11,3,5,"No no, that's me."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,11,3,6,"Oh, yeah."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,11,3,7,"Oh, hello."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,11,3,8,"Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh..."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,11,3,9,Is everything ok?
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,11,3,10,"Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,11,3,11,Oh my god.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,11,3,12,That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,11,3,13,"Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,2,11,3,14,"Oh, honey."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,11,3,15,"Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, ""ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage."" Little did she know God was thinking, ""Ok, but that's it."" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,11,3,16,What do you mean?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,11,3,17,I think it went into me.
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,11,7,2,Hi.
Carol Willick,Peaceful,2,11,7,3,How's it going?
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,11,7,4,It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
Carol Willick,Mad,2,11,7,5,"Fine, whatever."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,11,7,6,What's the matter?
Carol Willick,Sad,2,11,7,7,"Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,11,7,8,What?
Monica Geller,Mad,2,11,7,9,"You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,11,7,10,"Carol, what's the matter? What happened?"
Carol Willick,Sad,2,11,7,11,My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,11,7,12,Oh my god.
Carol Willick,Sad,2,11,7,13,"I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,11,7,14,It's ok. I'm sorry.
Carol Willick,Scared,2,11,7,15,"And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do."
Ross Geller,Powerful,2,11,7,16,"I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right."
Carol Willick,Mad,2,11,7,17,You do?
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,11,7,18,"Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this."
Carol Willick,Mad,2,11,7,19,Of course I do.
Ross Geller,Mad,2,11,7,20,"Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it."
Carol Willick,Neutral,2,11,7,21,You're right. Of course you're right.
Monica Geller,Scared,2,11,7,22,So we're back on?
Carol Willick,Powerful,2,11,7,23,We're back on.
Monica Geller,Powerful,2,11,7,24,"You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,11,8,2,"It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,11,8,3,"Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,11,8,4,"Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later."
Carol Willick,Neutral,2,11,8,5,Thank you.
Ross Geller,Sad,2,11,8,6,Any time.
Carol Willick,Peaceful,2,11,8,7,Ross.
Minister,Powerful,2,11,8,8,"You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,11,8,9,"Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,11,9,2,Would you look at them?
Ross Geller,Powerful,2,11,9,3,"Yeah, can't help but."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,11,9,4,How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,11,9,5,I miss Rose.
Chandler Bing,Sad,2,11,9,6,"Oh, yeah?"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,11,9,7,"I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone."
Woman,Mad,2,11,9,8,"You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,11,9,9,"Ok, that's so nice."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,2,11,9,10,"I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,11,9,11,"Hey, Mom? Having fun?"
Sandra Green,Joyful,2,11,9,12,"Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options."
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,11,9,13,"There's more alcohol, right?"
Susan Bunch,Neutral,2,11,10,2,How you doin'?
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,11,10,3,Ok.
Susan Bunch,Neutral,2,11,10,4,You did a good thing today.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,11,10,5,Yeah.
Susan Bunch,Neutral,2,11,10,6,You wanna dance?
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,11,10,7,"No, that's fine."
Susan Bunch,Neutral,2,11,10,8,Come on. I'll let you lead.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,11,10,9,Ok.
Chandler Bing,Sad,2,11,10,10,All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people.
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,11,11,2,"Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,11,11,3,"Well, Mon, I was married."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,11,11,4,"Yeah, me, too, technically."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,11,11,5,I had a wedding.
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,11,11,6,"All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,11,11,7,I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,11,11,8,Isn't Ben in this?
#ALL#,Joyful,2,11,11,9,"Oh, yeah!"
Ross Geller,Sad,2,12,1,3,That commercial always makes me so sad.
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,12,1,4,"Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK."
Ross Geller,Sad,2,12,1,5,I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,12,1,6,"I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,12,1,7,And the fact that they're both monkeys.
Ross Geller,Sad,2,12,1,8,"Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,12,1,9,"Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding."
Ross Geller,Sad,2,12,1,10,"Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,12,1,11,"Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,12,2,3,"Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,12,2,4,Rhythm?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,12,2,5,"No, my first fan mail."
#ALL#,Joyful,2,12,2,6,Alright!
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,12,2,7,"'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'"
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,12,2,8,"Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married."
Monica Geller,Scared,2,12,2,9,"This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,12,2,10,"Oh my god, I got my very own stalker."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,12,2,11,Hey guys.
#ALL#,Neutral,2,12,2,12,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,12,2,13,"Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,12,2,14,"Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,12,2,15,"You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion."
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,12,2,16,"Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,12,2,17,"Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,12,2,18,"I know, I know. Hello."
Rob,Powerful,2,12,2,19,Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,12,2,20,Hi Rob Dohnen.
Rob,Joyful,2,12,2,21,"I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,12,2,22,"Oh, wow."
Rob,Powerful,2,12,2,23,"Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,12,2,24,"Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,12,3,2,"Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,12,3,3,Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,12,3,4,Hello.
Erica Ford,Neutral,2,12,3,5,It's Erica.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,12,3,6,"Ah, the stalker."
Erica Ford,Neutral,2,12,3,7,"Never mind, it's open."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,2,12,3,8,"Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,12,3,9,Let's get out of here.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,12,3,10,The one time they're not home.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,12,3,11,"OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,12,3,12,That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,12,3,13,She's comin'.
Erica Ford,Neutral,2,12,3,14,It's me.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,12,3,15,"Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,12,3,16,"Wait, wait, wait."
Erica Ford,Joyful,2,12,3,17,Hi.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,12,3,18,Erica.
Dean Lipson,Neutral,2,12,4,2,"Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,12,4,3,"Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel."
Dean Lipson,Sad,2,12,4,4,"Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,12,4,5,"Oh my God, what happened?"
Dean Lipson,Sad,2,12,4,6,"Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,12,4,7,I can't believe this.
Dean Lipson,Neutral,2,12,4,8,"I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today."
Ross Geller,Mad,2,12,4,9,"Well, ya know, someone should have called me."
Dean Lipson,Neutral,2,12,4,10,"I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture."
Ross Geller,Mad,2,12,4,11,Zoo dollars?
Dean Lipson,Peaceful,2,12,4,12,"Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died."
Kids,Joyful,2,12,5,3,Ooohhh.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,12,5,4,I know.
Monica Geller,Mad,2,12,5,5,"I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,12,5,6,"Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,12,5,8,"Well, she looks the exact opposite of that."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,12,5,9,And she's not crazy?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,12,5,10,"Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,12,5,11,Oh my God.
Monica Geller,Scared,2,12,5,12,"Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,2,12,5,13,"Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac."
Rob,Peaceful,2,12,5,14,You OK?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,12,5,15,"No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear."
Rob,Peaceful,2,12,5,16,"That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,12,5,17,"I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?"
Ross Geller,Powerful,2,12,5,18,I was thinkin' about it.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,12,5,19,"OK. OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe"
#ALL#,Joyful,2,12,5,20,Hi Phoebe.

Erica Ford,Joyful,2,12,6,2,"Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,12,6,3,Yeah it is. . . what?
Erica Ford,Peaceful,2,12,6,4,"Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,12,6,5,"Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites."
Erica Ford,Neutral,2,12,6,6,Who's they?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,12,6,7,No one.
Erica Ford,Joyful,2,12,6,8,"Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,12,6,9,"Good, otherwise my watch would fall off."
Erica Ford,Joyful,2,12,6,10,"No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,12,6,11,"Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that."
Waiter,Scared,2,12,6,12,"Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?"
Erica Ford,Peaceful,2,12,6,13,"Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore."
Erica Ford,Scared,2,12,8,2,"I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,12,8,3,"Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something."
Erica Ford,Mad,2,12,8,4,"No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,12,8,5,But that's what...
Erica Ford,Peaceful,2,12,8,6,I should just be happy to be near you.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,12,8,7,Hey I-
Erica Ford,Neutral,2,12,8,8,Hey what?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,12,8,9,"That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,12,9,2,"There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . But don't. Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,12,9,3,Excellent!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,12,9,4,Very informative!
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,12,9,5,Not at all inappropriate!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,12,9,6,Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.
Rob,Peaceful,2,12,9,7,"That was great, the kids loved you."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,12,9,8,"Yay, I rock."
Rob,Joyful,2,12,9,9,"And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth.You were incredible."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,12,9,10,But.
Rob,Neutral,2,12,9,11,How did you know there was a but?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,12,9,12,I sense these things. It was either but or butter.
Rob,Joyful,2,12,9,13,"The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,12,9,14,I can do that.
Rob,Peaceful,2,12,9,15,Really?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,12,9,16,Yeah.
Rob,Joyful,2,12,9,17,Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,12,9,18,Thinkin' about it.
Janitor,Joyful,2,12,10,2,"Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,12,10,3,"Buddy, my monkey?"
Janitor,Powerful,2,12,10,4,"Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,12,10,5,Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
Janitor,Joyful,2,12,10,6,The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?
Ross Geller,Scared,2,12,10,7,"That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me."
Janitor,Scared,2,12,10,8,Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,12,10,9,That guy Lipson?
Janitor,Scared,2,12,10,10,Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,12,10,11,"No, I, I only know Lipson."
Janitor,Powerful,2,12,10,12,"Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with..."
Ross Geller,Sad,2,12,10,13,"Buddy, my monkey, my monkey."
Janitor,Powerful,2,12,10,14,"Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,12,10,15,Of course.
Janitor,Neutral,2,12,10,16,"Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,12,10,17,This is unbelievable.
Janitor,Powerful,2,12,10,18,"So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?"
Ross Geller,Sad,2,12,10,19,Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
Janitor,Neutral,2,12,10,20,Maybe.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,12,10,21,But you already told me everything.
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,12,11,2,"Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,12,11,3,"Well, so what're you gonna do?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,12,11,4,"Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,12,11,5,That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,12,11,6,"OK, hi again."
#ALL#,Neutral,2,12,11,7,Hi Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,12,11,8,"Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals. Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo, Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo. Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, And that's how we get hamburgers. Nooowww, chickens!"
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,12,13,2,Fired! Why?
Rob,Sad,2,12,13,3,The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,12,13,4,I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?
Rob,Neutral,2,12,13,5,No.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,12,13,6,I see.
Rob,Neutral,2,12,13,7,Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,12,13,8,"No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?"
Rob,Neutral,2,12,13,9,I'm not saying you have to be Barney.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,12,13,10,Who's Barney.
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,12,14,2,"Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan."
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,12,14,3,You're kidding.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,12,14,4,This is amazing.
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,12,14,5,I know.
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,12,14,6,I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,12,14,7,"OK, Rachel, I'm ready."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,12,14,8,OK.
Kid,Joyful,2,12,14,9,Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,12,14,10,"Um, yeah I guess that's me."
Kid,Joyful,2,12,14,11,She's here.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,12,14,12,"Sometimes men love women, sometimes men love men, and then there are bisexuals, though some just say they're kidding themselves. la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la..."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,12,15,2,"This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,12,15,3,"What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?"
Security Guard,Powerful,2,12,15,4,"C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,12,15,5,"Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?"
Security Guard,Powerful,2,12,15,6,"I'm sorry guys, closed set."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,12,15,7,"Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together."
Security Guard,Neutral,2,12,15,8,"Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,12,15,9,"Ross, there he is."

Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,13,2,3,"Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,13,2,4,Does anybody need anything?
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,13,2,5,"Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself."
Rachel Green,Sad,2,13,2,6,That is so unfair.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,13,2,7,"I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,13,2,8,"Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,13,2,9,You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,13,2,10,"Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,13,2,11,"Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,13,2,12,"Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,13,2,13,Stick a fork what?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,13,2,14,"Like, when you're cooking a steak."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,13,2,15,"Oh, OK, I don't eat meat."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,13,2,16,"Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,13,2,17,"Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,13,2,18,"OK, then, eat me, I'm done."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,13,2,19,"I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'"

Chandler Bing,Scared,2,13,2,21,"Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,13,2,22,"Oh, you just know."

Chandler Bing,Scared,2,13,3,6,"Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there."
Susie Moss,Powerful,2,13,3,7,"Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner."
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,13,3,8,You want me to wear your panties?
Susie Moss,Joyful,2,13,3,9,Could ya?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,13,3,10,"Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,13,4,2,"OK, got the music, got the dinner. Oh and check it out, I made Marcel's favorite dish, banannacake."

Monica Geller,Joyful,2,13,7,2,"I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy?"
Jean-Claude Van Damme,Neutral,2,13,7,3,Sure.
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,13,7,4,"This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date."
Jean-Claude Van Damme,Neutral,2,13,7,5,"Normally, I would not do it."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,13,7,6,"Well, what made you make the exception for me?"
Jean-Claude Van Damme,Neutral,2,13,7,7,"'Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, Drew Barrymore. By the way, Drew has some groundrules and..."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,13,8,2,Say you're sorry.
Rachel Green,Mad,2,13,8,3,No.
Monica Geller,Mad,2,13,8,4,Say it.
Rachel Green,Mad,2,13,8,5,No.
Monica Geller,Mad,2,13,8,6,"Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,13,8,7,"OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,13,8,8,Say you're sorry.
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,13,8,9,"OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play."
Monica Geller,Scared,2,13,8,10,What're you gonna do?
Rachel Green,Mad,2,13,8,11,You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
Monica Geller,Scared,2,13,8,12,You don't have the guts.
Rachel Green,Mad,2,13,8,13,"Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,13,8,14,"Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember why this even started in the first place?"
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,13,8,15,"Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,2,13,8,16,I'll help you fix your sweater.

Chandler Bing,Scared,2,14,1,17,"Oh, now? No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,14,1,18,"Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,14,1,19,I so am.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,14,1,20,You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,14,1,21,"Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track."
Interviewer,Neutral,2,14,2,2,"Well, this all looks good."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,14,2,3,Great.

Interviewer,Neutral,2,14,2,6,"Alright, lets see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad."
Monica Geller,Powerful,2,14,2,7,"A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like."
Interviewer,Neutral,2,14,2,8,"No, just a salad will be fine."
Monica Geller,Powerful,2,14,2,9,You got it.
Interviewer,Neutral,2,14,2,10,"Now, I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it."
Monica Geller,Scared,2,14,2,11,"Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce."
Interviewer,Neutral,2,14,2,12,Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,14,2,13,"Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it."
Interviewer,Joyful,2,14,2,14,"Don't, I like it dirty."
Monica Geller,Scared,2,14,2,15,That's your call.
Interviewer,Powerful,2,14,2,16,"So, uh, what are you going to do next?"
Monica Geller,Scared,2,14,2,17,"Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos."
Interviewer,Joyful,2,14,2,18,"Are they, uh, firm?"
Monica Geller,Scared,2,14,2,19,They'r alright.
Interviewer,Joyful,2,14,2,20,"You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad?"
Monica Geller,Scared,2,14,2,21,"No really, they're OK."
Interviewer,Joyful,2,14,2,22,You gonna slice them up real nice?
Monica Geller,Scared,2,14,2,23,"Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne."

Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,14,3,3,"Oh, some guy she met at the movies."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,14,3,4,"Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,14,3,5,"Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight."

Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,14,3,7,"Hang in there, it's gonna happen."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,14,3,8,"Wha, OK, now how do you know that?"
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,14,3,9,Because she's your lobster.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,14,3,10,"Oh, she's goin' somewhere."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,14,3,11,"C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . ."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,14,3,12,"Hey, you feelin' better?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,14,3,13,"Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,14,3,14,"So, do you have any other possibilities?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,14,3,15,"Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,14,3,16,"Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money."
Monica Geller,Sad,2,14,3,17,"No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,14,3,18,"Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them."
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,14,3,19,"Ya know, the man's got a point."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,14,3,20,What is that sparkly thing?
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,14,3,21,"That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,14,3,22,"No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,14,3,23,"Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,14,4,2,Hi.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,14,4,3,Hi.

Monica Geller,Neutral,2,14,4,5,"So, what's this."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,14,4,6,Some of your old stuff.
Judy Geller,Joyful,2,14,4,7,"Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,14,4,8,"Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,14,4,9,"Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,14,4,10,"Oh, God forbid."
Judy Geller,Neutral,2,14,4,11,"Oh, hi Rachel."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,14,4,12,Hi.
Judy Geller,Peaceful,2,14,4,13,"Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,14,4,14,"Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,14,4,15,"Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,14,4,16,"What, what incident?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,14,4,17,"Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,14,5,2,Do you want a refill?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,14,5,3,"No, I'm alright, thanks."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,14,5,4,"OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,14,5,5,"I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's."
Gail,Neutral,2,14,5,6,I'm Gail.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,14,5,7,Chandler.
Gail,Scared,2,14,5,8,"I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,14,5,9,"What? Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,14,5,10,It's not that bad.
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,14,5,11,"Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,14,5,12,"Chandler, Chandler."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,14,5,13,"I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,14,7,2,"Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,14,7,3,"If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,14,7,4,"Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,14,7,5,"Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?"
Chandler Bing,Sad,2,14,7,6,"OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,14,7,7,You know what the. . .
Chandler Bing,Sad,2,14,7,8,"I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . ."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,14,8,2,"You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,14,8,3,Hey guys.
Judy Geller,Joyful,2,14,8,4,"Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,14,8,5,"No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,14,8,6,A woman in my office is a lesiban. I'm just saying.
Judy Geller,Joyful,2,14,8,7,"Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,14,8,8,Where have you been?
Ross Geller,Scared,2,14,8,9,"Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?"
Monica Geller,Scared,2,14,8,10,"No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet."
Ross Geller,Powerful,2,14,8,11,"C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news."
Monica Geller,Scared,2,14,8,12,"Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it."
Judy Geller,Neutral,2,14,8,13,Why?
Monica Geller,Scared,2,14,8,14,Because they made me.
Judy Geller,Scared,2,14,8,15,You were fired? What're you gonna do?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,14,8,16,"Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,14,8,18,"There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it."
Monica Geller,Scared,2,14,8,19,Anything larger back there?
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,14,9,2,I can't believe it.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,14,9,3,Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,14,9,4,"Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,14,9,5,Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,14,9,6,"Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two."
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,14,9,7,"What am I gonna do, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,14,9,8,Hey.

Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,14,9,11,Well this one's for you.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,14,9,12,Get out.
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,14,9,13,"No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,14,9,14,"Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,14,9,15,That's what they'll call us.
Judy Geller,Neutral,2,14,11,2,Dance with him.
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,14,11,3,"Mom, I'm hungry."
Judy Geller,Neutral,2,14,11,4,Dance with your father.
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,14,11,5,I may not know any of your flash dances but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,14,11,6,Alright.
Judy Geller,Joyful,2,14,11,7,"Oh, Jack."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,14,11,8,"Oh, Judy. Oh, Judy."

Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,15,1,3,"Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,15,1,4,Alright open your eyes.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,15,1,5,Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.

Monica Geller,Joyful,2,15,3,9,"I've been great, just great. How have you been?"
Richard Burke,Peaceful,2,15,3,10,"Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,15,3,11,The head tilt?
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,15,3,12,"Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. 'How ya doin'? You OK?'"
Monica Geller,Sad,2,15,3,13,I'm sorry.
Richard Burke,Sad,2,15,3,14,"No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. 'I'm OK.' 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,15,3,15,"Oh, that's too bad."
Richard Burke,Peaceful,2,15,3,16,I'll survive.
Monica Geller,Powerful,2,15,5,2,"You've got to get back out there, it's your party."
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,15,5,3,"But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,15,5,4,You're an opthamologist.
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,15,5,5,"Only because my parents wanted me to be, I wanted to be a sherrif."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,15,5,6,"That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there."
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,15,5,7,See.
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,15,5,8,"Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency."
Richard Burke,Joyful,2,15,5,9,"OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this. Who needs glasses?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,15,5,10,You are so smitten.
Monica Geller,Mad,2,15,5,11,I am not.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,15,5,12,"Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out."
Monica Geller,Scared,2,15,5,13,"Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,15,5,14,So. You two are totally into each other.
Monica Geller,Scared,2,15,5,15,"Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,15,5,16,"OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,15,5,17,"Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,15,5,18,"Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,15,5,19,"Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age."

Ross Geller,Scared,2,15,7,9,"Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,15,7,10,"Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,15,7,11,She laughed at you?
Ross Geller,Sad,2,15,7,12,"Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,15,7,13,It's the Miracle Wax.

Ross Geller,Joyful,2,15,7,23,"Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,15,7,24,What's this.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,15,7,25,Could you get us a couple of beers?

Rachel Green,Neutral,2,15,13,12,"Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,15,13,13,You're not laughing.
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,15,13,14,This time it's not so funny.
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,15,13,15,"Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,15,13,16,"What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,15,13,17,"Oh, thank God."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,15,14,2,Hi.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,15,14,3,Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
Ross Geller,Scared,2,15,14,4,I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.
Rachel Green,Scared,2,15,14,5,What?
Ross Geller,Scared,2,15,14,6,We're not alone.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,16,1,2,Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,16,1,3,"That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years."
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,16,1,4,Waaa-aaah.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,16,1,5,What?
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,16,1,6,The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,16,1,7,"Yeah, so."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,16,1,8,Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,16,1,9,"Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,16,1,10,"Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,16,1,11,"Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,16,1,12,Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,16,1,13,"Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,16,3,2,"Alright, shall we?"
Monica Geller,Scared,2,16,3,3,"OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,16,3,4,"Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. We're here."
Judy Geller,Joyful,2,16,3,5,Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,16,3,6,Happy birthday dad.
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,16,3,7,Oh thank you.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,16,3,8,Hi ma.
Richard Burke,Joyful,2,16,3,9,Happy birthday.
Judy Geller,Neutral,2,16,3,10,"Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,16,3,11,"Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us."
Friend,Neutral,2,16,4,2,"Well, you kids take the train in?"
Judy Geller,Neutral,2,16,4,3,"No, Richard Burke gave them a ride."
Friend,Neutral,2,16,4,4,"Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city."
Monica Geller,Scared,2,16,4,5,"Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom."
Judy Geller,Neutral,2,16,4,6,"Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,16,4,7,Are we still on that?
Judy Geller,Mad,2,16,4,8,We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
Friend,Peaceful,2,16,4,9,"She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,16,5,2,Can you believe this place?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,16,5,3,"I know, this is a great apartment."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,16,5,4,"Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,16,5,5,"Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously."
Joey's Co-Star,Neutral,2,16,5,6,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,16,5,7,"Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man."
Joey's Co-Star,Neutral,2,16,5,8,Thanks. You want it?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,16,5,9,Huh?
Joey's Co-Star,Powerful,2,16,5,10,"Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,16,5,11,"Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?"
Joey's Co-Star,Powerful,2,16,5,12,Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,16,5,13,"Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,16,6,2,"C'mon, tell us."
Friend,Neutral,2,16,6,3,"Yeah, is she really 20."
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,16,6,4,I am not telling you guys anything.
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,16,6,5,"C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,16,6,6,"Dad, you really don't want to do that."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,16,6,7,"Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?"
Richard Burke,Mad,2,16,6,8,"Jack, would you let it go?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,16,6,9,"Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster."
Richard Burke,Joyful,2,16,6,10,"Guys. Seriously, it is not like that."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,16,6,11,"Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . ."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,16,6,12,"Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,16,6,13,What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,16,7,2,"OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,16,7,3,Well I. . .
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,16,7,4,"I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh."
Tattoo Artist,Powerful,2,16,7,5,"Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,16,7,6,Here we go.
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,16,7,7,Uh-huh.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,16,7,8,You're not going?
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,16,7,9,Uh-huh.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,16,7,10,What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?
Rachel Green,Scared,2,16,7,11,"No. Well, yeah, maybe."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,16,7,12,"I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,16,7,13,What's 1922?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,16,7,14,"Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,16,7,15,"Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . ."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,16,7,16,"OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,16,7,17,No.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,16,7,18,"OK, who is the boss of you?!!"
Rachel Green,Scared,2,16,7,19,You?
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,16,7,20,No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!
Richard Burke,Joyful,2,16,8,2,How ya doin'?
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,16,8,3,I'm a twinkie.
Richard Burke,Powerful,2,16,8,4,Really? I'm a hero.
Monica Geller,Sad,2,16,8,5,"Oh, this is so hard."
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,16,8,6,"Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them."
Monica Geller,Scared,2,16,8,7,Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
Richard Burke,Sad,2,16,8,8,My parents are dead.
Monica Geller,Scared,2,16,8,9,"God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean."
Richard Burke,Powerful,2,16,8,10,"I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,2,16,8,11,Alright.
Richard Burke,Joyful,2,16,8,12,"Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you."
Judy Geller,Peaceful,2,16,8,13,"Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support."
Ross Geller,Mad,2,16,8,14,"Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one."
Judy Geller,Joyful,2,16,8,15,I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,16,8,16,I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
Judy Geller,Joyful,2,16,8,17,I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,16,8,18,"Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her."
Judy Geller,Neutral,2,16,8,19,Really.
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,16,8,20,"I tell you, I've never seen him this happy."
Judy Geller,Scared,2,16,8,21,"So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,16,8,22,Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.
Judy Geller,Joyful,2,16,8,23,Oh Jack stop.
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,16,8,24,"C'mon, it's my birthday."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,16,9,2,Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,2,16,9,3,"Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,16,9,4,"Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,16,9,5,Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,16,9,6,"Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,16,9,7,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,16,9,8,"I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,2,16,9,9,"Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,16,9,10,"What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,16,9,11,"Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,16,9,12,Well that's how I feel.
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,16,9,13,Well then maybe you should take it.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,16,9,14,Well then maybe I will.
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,16,9,15,Fine with me.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,16,9,16,"Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,16,10,2,Who's drink can I freshen?
Judy Geller,Neutral,2,16,10,3,Almost time for cake.
Ross Geller,Scared,2,16,10,4,"Mon, Mon, are you OK?"
Monica Geller,Scared,2,16,10,5,You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,16,10,6,Yeah.
Monica Geller,Scared,2,16,10,7,"Well, I just caught the live show."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,16,10,8,Eww.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,16,12,2,"Oh that looks so good, oh I love it."
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,16,12,3,"I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,16,12,4,"Ahh. OK, let's see yours again."
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,16,12,5,"Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,16,12,6,"Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,16,12,7,You didn't get it?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,16,12,8,No.
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,16,12,9,Why didn't you get it?
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,16,12,10,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,16,12,11,"Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,16,12,12,"I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,16,12,13,"Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,16,16,2,"Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,16,16,3,"Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . except when we are here."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,16,16,4,I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.
Monica Geller,Sad,2,16,16,5,"I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore."
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,16,16,6,"Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,16,16,7,"Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,16,16,8,"Yeah, I remember."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,16,16,9,"Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,16,16,10,"So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,16,16,11,"Naa, you keep it, you need the practice."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,16,16,12,Thanks.
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,16,16,13,"So, I guess this is it."
Chandler Bing,Sad,2,16,16,14,"Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,16,16,15,"Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,16,16,16,"Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,16,16,17,"Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care."
Chandler Bing,Sad,2,16,16,18,Yeah.

Rachel Green,Powerful,2,17,1,9,"Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?"

Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,17,2,12,"I'm not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,17,2,13,I'm done now.

Ross Geller,Scared,2,17,2,19,"I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,17,3,2,"Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom."

Ross Geller,Joyful,2,17,3,12,I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
Monica Geller,Mad,2,17,3,13,Shut up.
Ross Geller,Mad,2,17,3,14,Shut up.

Ross Geller,Joyful,2,17,3,16,Mi-mi-mii.

Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,17,4,2,"So, whaddya say boys, should I call him? Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question... you're going crazy."

Both,Joyful,2,17,4,15,Baywatch!!
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,17,4,16,"Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,17,4,17,I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,17,4,18,"Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,17,4,19,"Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?"
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,17,4,20,"Hey, hey, they're runnin'"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,17,4,21,"See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,2,17,5,2,But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,17,5,3,"I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,17,5,4,"Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,17,5,5,"You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,2,17,5,6,"I promise you, he would definitely want you back."
Ross Geller,Mad,2,17,6,2,"I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,17,6,3,"But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together."
Ross Geller,Powerful,2,17,6,4,"Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated."
Rachel Green,Powerful,2,17,6,5,"Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too."
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,17,6,6,But...
Ross Geller,Powerful,2,17,6,7,"No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore."
Producer,Peaceful,2,17,7,2,"OK Phoebe, you ready to try one?"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,17,7,3,"OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?"
Producer,Peaceful,2,17,7,4,They're your backup singers... beind you.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,17,7,5,"OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know."
Producer,Powerful,2,17,7,6,Alrighty. From the top.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,17,7,7,"OK. Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat."
Producer,Peaceful,2,17,7,8,"Honey, uh we, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about a hundred dollars a minute to be in here."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,17,7,9,"Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,17,8,2,"No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. Oh, were you takin' a nap?"
Monica Geller,Peaceful,2,17,8,3,I was.
Ross Geller,Scared,2,17,8,4,"Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. Call Joanna. Hi."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,17,8,5,Did she leave a number?
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,17,8,6,Did you see me write one down?
Monica Geller,Mad,2,17,8,7,"I don't have her number, butt-munch."
Ross Geller,Powerful,2,17,8,8,"Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,17,8,9,"I'm not a baby, you're the baby."
Ross Geller,Mad,2,17,8,10,"Look, you wanna get off my back?"
Monica Geller,Mad,2,17,8,11,You wanna get out of my face?
Ross Geller,Scared,2,17,8,12,"Wait hold on Tony, hold on. Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right here. Um hold on. Hi Tony, can I call you back? That's uh, that's my sister's boyfriend."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,17,8,13,Give me that.
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,17,8,14,OK.
Monica Geller,Mad,2,17,8,15,"Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom."

Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,17,9,6,"Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just toss it out?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,17,9,7,"Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie."

Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,17,9,10,"At the uh, supermarket, in the uh, ethnic food section. I helped him pick out a chorizo."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,17,9,11,Wow.
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,17,9,12,"Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,17,9,13,"Oh, now it's a spare room?"

Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,17,9,18,"Yeah, yeah he is."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,17,10,2,I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,17,10,3,"Uh, Eddie something. He just met him."

Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,17,11,6,"Oh it's uh, over there on the table."

Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,17,11,8,"No, Eddie likes to keep it over there."
Eddie Menuek,Peaceful,2,17,11,9,"Alright, here you go my friend. Eggs a-la Eddie, huh?"

Chandler Bing,Scared,2,17,11,14,"Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good."
Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,17,11,15,"Well you guys, I'm outta here. See ya pals."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,17,11,16,See ya.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,17,11,17,So how you two gettin' along?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,17,11,18,"Oh, I couldn't be happier."

And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,17,11,20,There's another carton right over there.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,17,11,21,"Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,17,11,22,"Alright, so what's it about?"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,17,11,23,"Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,17,11,24,Well I like both eggs equally.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,17,11,25,Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,17,11,26,"Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,17,13,3,Hey.
#ALL#,Neutral,2,17,13,4,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,17,13,5,"Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video."
#ALL#,Joyful,2,17,13,6,No.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,17,13,7,Yes.
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,17,13,8,"Well, how did you find out?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,17,13,9,"Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,17,13,10,So what're you gonna do?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,17,13,11,"Well, I can't work with people who would do this."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,17,13,12,Sure.
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,17,13,13,I mean this poor woman.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,17,13,14,What woman?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,17,13,15,"The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,17,13,16,"OK, Phoebs. But what about you?"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,17,13,17,"Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,17,14,2,"Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?"
Eddie Menuek,Sad,2,17,14,3,"No thanks man, I'm not uh, I'm not really into sports."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,17,14,4,"Yeah o-, OK, alright. Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch."
Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,17,14,5,"Y-, y-, you like that show?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,17,14,6,You don't like that show?
Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,17,14,7,"Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,17,14,8,Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,17,14,9,"I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,17,14,10,"Oh o-, OK man."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,17,15,2,"Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody."
#ALL#,Joyful,2,17,15,3,"Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, it's not your fault."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,17,15,4,Monica.
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,17,15,5,They won't take you to the vet.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,17,15,6,Chandler.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,17,15,7,You're obviously not their favorite pet.
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,17,15,8,Joey.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,17,15,9,It may not be a bed of roses.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,17,15,10,Rachel.
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,17,15,11,And you're no friend to those with noses.
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,17,15,12,"Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more."
Amber,Neutral,2,18,1,2,Oh Drake.
Dr. Drake Ramoray,Mad,2,18,1,3,I'm sorry Amber. It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.
Ross Geller,Scared,2,18,1,4,"I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,18,1,5,"We, we just wanna see the end."
Amber,Powerful,2,18,1,6,I want you Drake.
Dr. Drake Ramoray,Neutral,2,18,1,7,I know you do but you and I can never be together that way.
Amber,Neutral,2,18,1,8,What?
Dr. Drake Ramoray,Neutral,2,18,1,9,There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,18,1,10,So what happens next?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,18,1,11,"Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,18,1,12,God that is good TV.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,18,2,2,"Phoebs, play with meeee."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,18,2,3,"No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,18,2,4,"Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,18,2,5,Why don't you play with your roommate?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,18,2,6,"Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,18,2,7,"Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,18,2,8,"No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,18,2,9,"Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?"
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,18,2,10,We don't need to remedy that.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,18,2,11,"Oh yeah, it'll be fun."
Eddie Menuek,Scared,2,18,2,12,What was that?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,18,2,13,"Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other."
Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,18,2,14,"Yeah alright, that sounds alright."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,18,2,15,"Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye."
Chandler Bing,Sad,2,18,2,16,That was so lame.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,18,2,17,"I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him."
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,18,2,18,"So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?"
Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,18,3,2,"That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,18,3,3,What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,18,3,4,"That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh..."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,18,3,5,Well it's not Sean Penn.
Eddie Menuek,Joyful,2,18,3,6,"Not Sean Penn. Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My last girlfriend Tilly. Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, and I made all these pancakes, there was like 50 pancakes right. And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop. That uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,18,4,2,"And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night."
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,18,4,3,"Phoebe's got another job, right?"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,18,4,4,Great set tonight Phoebs.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,18,4,5,I know.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,18,4,6,"Well, we should probably get going."
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,18,4,7,"Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,18,4,8,"Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place."
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,18,4,9,"I don't know, I don't have my jammies."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,18,4,10,"Well, maybe you don't need them."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,18,4,11,"My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,18,4,12,"Shut up, I'm happy."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,18,4,13,"Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best."
Richard Burke,Joyful,2,18,4,14,"Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,18,4,15,Ok.
Richard Burke,Sad,2,18,4,16,"Hear that? She likes me best, and apparently there've been a lot."
Monica Geller,Sad,2,18,4,17,"Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy."
Rachel Green,Sad,2,18,4,18,Phoebe's dead.
Tilly,Neutral,2,18,5,2,Hi.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,18,5,3,Hi.
Tilly,Neutral,2,18,5,4,I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,18,5,5,"Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?"
Tilly,Neutral,2,18,5,6,Thanks.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,18,5,7,"Oh, oh, c'mon in."

Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,18,5,9,Oh.
Tilly,Neutral,2,18,5,10,I gather by that oh that he told you about me.
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,18,5,11,"Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul."
Tilly,Powerful,2,18,5,12,He's kind of intense huh?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,18,5,13,"Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little..."
Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,18,5,14,A little what?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,18,5,15,Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.
Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,18,5,16,Hello Tilly.
Tilly,Neutral,2,18,5,17,"Eddie, I just came by to drop off your tank."
Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,18,5,18,That's very thoughtful of you. It's very thougtful.
Tilly,Neutral,2,18,5,19,"Well, ok then. I'm gonna go. Bye."
Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,18,5,20,Bye-bye.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,18,5,21,Bye.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,18,5,22,"So, we gettin' a fish?"
Eddie Menuek,Mad,2,18,5,23,You had sex with her didn't you?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,18,6,2,"Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,18,6,3,"Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,18,6,4,"Page 42, page 42, page 42."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,18,6,5,"Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,18,6,6,"Ooh, I look good."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,18,6,7,"Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?"
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,18,6,8,"Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,18,6,9,"Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,18,6,10,"Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,18,8,2,"I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?"
Delivery Guy,Neutral,2,18,8,3,"Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,18,8,4,"They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son."
Delivery Guy,Neutral,2,18,8,5,Right. Could you sign this?
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,18,8,6,"No. No way, I'm not signing that."
Delivery Guy,Neutral,2,18,8,7,I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,18,8,8,How can they do this to me?
Delivery Guy,Scared,2,18,8,9,"Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,18,9,2,"Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,18,9,3,"Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,18,9,4,G'night.
Richard Burke,Peaceful,2,18,9,5,Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
Monica Geller,Scared,2,18,9,6,"Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with."
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,18,9,7,Two.
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,18,9,8,"Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?"
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,18,9,9,"Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,18,9,10,"Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth."
Richard Burke,Joyful,2,18,9,11,"Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,18,9,12,"Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark."
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,18,9,13,"Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,18,9,14,"Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?"
Rachel Green,Scared,2,18,9,15,Uhhhooo.
Ross Geller,Mad,2,18,9,16,"C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them."
Rachel Green,Sad,2,18,9,17,"Well, there's you."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,18,9,18,Better not be doin' these in order.
Rachel Green,Scared,2,18,9,19,"Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo."
Ross Geller,Mad,2,18,9,20,"Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini."
Rachel Green,Sad,2,18,9,21,"Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,18,9,22,Really?
Rachel Green,Scared,2,18,9,23,"Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,18,10,2,"Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend."
Eddie Menuek,Mad,2,18,10,3,"That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,18,10,4,"This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story."
Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,18,10,5,Where's Buddy?
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,18,10,6,Buddy?
Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,18,10,7,"My fish, Buddy."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,18,10,8,There was no fish when she dropped it off.
Eddie Menuek,Mad,2,18,10,9,"Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,18,10,10,Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,18,13,2,C'mon.
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,18,13,3,Joey.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,18,13,4,Open up. We want to talk to you.
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,18,13,5,I don't feel like talkin.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,18,13,6,"Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,18,13,7,We're worried about you.
Monica Geller,Mad,2,18,13,8,And some of us really have to pee.
Monica Geller,Sad,2,18,13,9,Sorry Joey
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,18,13,10,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,18,13,11,"Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,18,13,12,We came over as soon as we saw.
Ross Geller,Sad,2,18,13,13,How could you not tell us?
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,18,13,14,"I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out."
Rachel Green,Powerful,2,18,13,15,"Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,18,13,16,"Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,18,13,17,"But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,18,13,18,"Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,18,13,19,"Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,18,13,20,"Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,18,13,21,It's gonna be ok. You know that?
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,18,13,22,"No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,18,13,23,I'm sorry man.
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,18,13,24,"Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,18,13,25,"No, that means nothin to me."

Eddie Menuek,Joyful,2,18,14,7,"I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you."
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,18,14,8,"Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker."
Eddie Menuek,Powerful,2,18,14,9,What's you point man?

Chandler Bing,Mad,2,19,1,9,"No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now."
Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,19,1,10,"Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,19,1,11,Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.
Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,19,1,12,"No. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh? What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,19,1,13,I didn't realize that.
Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,19,1,14,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,19,1,15,GET OUT NOW!!
Eddie Menuek,Sad,2,19,1,16,"Ok, you really want me out?"

Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,19,1,19,I want you out.
Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,19,1,20,"No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,19,1,21,Where did you hear it from before?
Eddie Menuek,Mad,2,19,1,22,"Oh, right, all right, you know what pallie I understand, consider me gone, you know what, I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow."
Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,19,1,23,I heard that.
Estelle Leonard,Neutral,2,19,3,2,Don't worry about it already. Things happen.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,19,3,3,"So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?"
Estelle Leonard,Neutral,2,19,3,4,"Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,19,3,5,"No, can we get back to me?"
Estelle Leonard,Powerful,2,19,3,6,"Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,19,3,7,Alright. Cab driver number two?
Estelle Leonard,Powerful,2,19,3,8,You're welcome.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,19,3,9,But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
Estelle Leonard,Neutral,2,19,3,10,"Things change, roll with em."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,19,3,11,"But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this."
Estelle Leonard,Powerful,2,19,3,12,"Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,19,3,13,I'm sorry. See ya.
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,19,4,2,"Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,19,4,3,Isn't it.
Rachel Green,Powerful,2,19,4,4,"Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,19,4,5,I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,19,4,6,Hey you guys.
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,19,4,7,Hey.
Ross Geller,Scared,2,19,4,8,"Uh, sweetie we've gotta go."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,19,4,9,NO!
Ross Geller,Scared,2,19,4,10,No?
Rachel Green,Mad,2,19,4,11,"No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,19,4,12,Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
Rachel Green,Mad,2,19,4,13,"No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind."
Monica Geller,Powerful,2,19,4,14,You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
Ross Geller,Mad,2,19,4,15,"Excuse me, your, your, your wind?"
Rachel Green,Powerful,2,19,4,16,"Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,19,4,17,"You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,19,4,18,"Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,19,4,19,"Um-um, um-um."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,19,4,20,"You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!"
Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,19,6,2,Hey pal.
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,19,6,3,Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
Eddie Menuek,Joyful,2,19,6,4,"Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,19,6,5,"Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?"
Eddie Menuek,Peaceful,2,19,6,6,"Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,19,6,7,"Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?"
Eddie Menuek,Joyful,2,19,6,8,"Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,19,6,9,Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
Eddie Menuek,Joyful,2,19,6,10,"Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,19,6,11,Your last roommate's kidney?
Eddie Menuek,Neutral,2,19,6,12,That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,19,7,2,"Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go."
Gunther,Scared,2,19,7,3,Lemonade? You ok man?
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,19,7,4,"Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show."
Gunther,Neutral,2,19,7,5,"Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,19,7,6,I fell down an elevator shaft.
Gunther,Sad,2,19,7,7,That sucks. I was buried in an avalanche.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,19,7,8,What?
Gunther,Neutral,2,19,7,9,I used to be Bryce on All My Children.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,19,8,3,Daaahhhh!
Monica Geller,Scared,2,19,8,4,Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,19,8,5,"Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,19,8,6,I wa-
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,19,8,7,Uuuh.
Eddie Menuek,Joyful,2,19,9,2,"Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,19,9,3,"Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out."
Eddie Menuek,Sad,2,19,9,4,What?
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,19,9,5,"You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!"
Eddie Menuek,Sad,2,19,9,6,"You, you want, you want me to move out?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,19,9,7,Uh-huh.
Eddie Menuek,Mad,2,19,9,8,"I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,19,9,9,"This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue."
Eddie Menuek,Mad,2,19,9,10,"Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack!"
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,19,9,11,You want some help.
Eddie Menuek,Scared,2,19,9,12,No help required Chico.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,19,10,2,"All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks."
Casting Guy,Mad,2,19,10,3,"Excuse me, that's 50 bucks."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,19,10,4,What?
Casting Guy,Powerful,2,19,10,5,Five oh dollars.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,19,10,6,"Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything."
Casting Guy,Mad,2,19,10,7,That's great.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,19,10,8,"And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting."
Casting Guy,Powerful,2,19,10,9,"Ok, listen, thanks for coming in."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,19,10,10,"No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,19,11,2,"Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,2,19,11,3,And I would have to say pah-huh.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,19,11,4,What?
Monica Geller,Scared,2,19,11,5,Do you not remember the puppet guy?
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,19,11,6,Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,19,11,7,And his puppet too.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,19,11,8,"Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date."
Monica Geller,Scared,2,19,11,9,Who?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,19,11,10,Paul.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,2,19,11,11,Oh.
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,19,11,12,"Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,19,11,13,"Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,19,11,14,"Not uh, not to my recollection."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,2,19,11,15,"Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me."
Rachel Green,Powerful,2,19,11,16,Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,19,11,17,Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,19,11,18,Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
Monica Geller,Mad,2,19,11,19,One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,19,14,3,May I help you?
Eddie Menuek,Mad,2,19,14,4,Why doesn't my key work and what's all my stuff doin' downstairs?
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,19,14,5,"Well, I'm, I'm sorry... Ahhh. Have we met?"
Eddie Menuek,Mad,2,19,14,6,"It's Eddie you freak, your roommate."
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,19,14,7,"I, I'm sorry, I uh I already have a roommate."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,19,14,8,Hello.
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,19,14,9,"Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man."
Eddie Menuek,Mad,2,19,14,10,"No he, he moved out and I moved in."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,19,14,11,"Well I, I think we'd remember something like that."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,19,14,12,I know I would.
Eddie Menuek,Sad,2,19,14,13,"Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then. I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,19,14,14,Hey no problem.

Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,19,14,16,"Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is..."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,19,14,17,Welcome home man.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,19,14,18,A little foos?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,19,14,19,Absolutely.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,19,14,20,What happened to the foosball?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,19,14,21,Ah that's a cantelope.
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,19,15,2,"Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?"
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,19,15,3,He paid a lot of money for it.
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,19,15,4,"I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,19,15,5,"Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,19,15,6,"So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,20,1,2,Hey. Watcha guys doin?
Richard Burke,Sad,2,20,1,3,Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,20,1,4,"Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,20,1,5,What?
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,20,1,6,What're you talkin' about?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,20,1,7,"C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,20,1,8,"Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,20,1,9,What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,20,1,10,That's not the end.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,20,1,11,Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
Monica Geller,Scared,2,20,1,12,What about the part where he has rabies?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,20,1,13,"He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said."
Richard Burke,Scared,2,20,1,14,"Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,20,1,15,"What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,2,20,2,2,"Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,20,2,3,"Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,20,2,4,"Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,20,2,5,"Well, how do you find clothes that fit?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,20,2,6,"Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,20,2,7,"Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,20,2,8,"No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket."
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,20,2,9,"Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'"
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,20,2,10,"Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,20,2,11,"Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?"
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,20,2,12,"Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,20,2,13,"Ok, that's Eric."
Richard Burke,Joyful,2,20,2,14,Glad to be of help. Matches.
Monica Geller,Scared,2,20,2,15,"I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,20,2,16,I don't know.
Monica Geller,Scared,2,20,2,17,C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,20,2,18,"I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,20,2,19,"So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,20,2,20,How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,20,2,21,"Ok, this could be tough."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,20,2,22,"Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,20,2,23,"Ooh, you almost had it."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,20,3,2,"No no, you're fine, you're fine."

Ross Geller,Mad,2,20,3,13,"I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?"
Carol Willick,Powerful,2,20,3,14,"Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen."

Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,20,8,2,Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,20,8,3,Did you like it?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,20,8,4,"Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed."
Monica Geller,Powerful,2,20,8,5,"Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,20,8,6,"I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, ""It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."""
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,21,1,2,"Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,21,1,3,"'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,21,1,4,"Ok honey, you really need a job."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,21,1,5,"Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview."
Monica Geller,Scared,2,21,1,6,Really.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,21,1,7,"Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,21,1,8,"On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,21,1,9,"No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name."
#ALL#,Neutral,2,21,1,10,Ahh.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,21,1,11,And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
Monica Geller,Scared,2,21,1,12,His indian name?
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,21,1,13,No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,21,1,14,Freakish.
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,21,1,15,Wow.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,21,1,16,Freaky.
Monica Geller,Scared,2,21,1,17,"Weird, weird."
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,21,1,18,"Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,21,1,19,"Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him."
Monica Geller,Scared,2,21,1,20,Why?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,21,1,21,"Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,21,2,2,"Man, I am so beat."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,21,2,3,Oh yeah.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,21,2,4,"Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,21,2,5,Yeah alright.
Big Bully,Mad,2,21,2,6,Hey you're in our seats.
Ross Geller,Scared,2,21,2,7,"Oh, sorry we didn't know."
Little Bully,Mad,2,21,2,8,"Hey, we were sitting there."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,21,2,9,"Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?"
Little Bully,Mad,2,21,2,10,Is that supposed to be funny?
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,21,2,11,"No actually, I was just going for colorful."
Big Bully,Mad,2,21,2,12,What's with this guy?
Little Bully,Mad,2,21,2,13,What's with you?
Ross Geller,Scared,2,21,2,14,"Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,21,2,15,What just happened?
Little Bully,Mad,2,21,2,16,"I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat."
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,21,2,17,"That, that is funny. Can I have it back?"
Little Bully,Mad,2,21,2,18,No.
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,21,2,19,No?
Big Bully,Mad,2,21,2,20,No.
Ross Geller,Mad,2,21,2,21,"Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat."
Big Bully,Mad,2,21,2,22,Why should we?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,21,2,23,"Because it's a special hat. See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler..."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,21,2,24,"Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?"
Big Bully,Mad,2,21,2,25,You got a problem with that?
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,21,2,26,"No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,21,4,3,"See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,21,4,4,"Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,21,4,5,"We love you, we're here for you."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,21,4,6,"Yeah good luck, good luck."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,21,4,7,Thanks.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,21,4,8,"Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,21,4,9,"Ohh, what is in that?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,21,4,10,"Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,21,4,11,"No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,21,4,12,"Hey, hey, no, oh oh."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,21,4,13,Run Phoebe run.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,21,4,14,"No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,21,4,15,"Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?"
Rachel Green,Mad,2,21,4,16,Are you kidding me?
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,21,4,17,"Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,21,4,18,Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,21,4,19,"Ok, here, I know what we can do."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,21,4,20,"Hey, hey, hey no."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,21,4,21,"Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,21,4,22,"Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,21,4,23,Are you crazy?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,21,4,24,"Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,21,6,2,"Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,21,6,3,"Yeah, I don't know."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,21,6,4,What's the matter?
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,21,6,5,"I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,21,6,6,"Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,21,6,7,"Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,21,6,8,"Ok, thanks. Sorry, again"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,21,6,9,What was that?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,21,6,10,"Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,21,8,2,Your cappucino sir.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,21,8,3,Thank you.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,21,8,4,Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,21,8,5,Absolutely.
Ross Geller,Scared,2,21,8,6,How come it's not mixing with the water?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,21,8,7,"Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,21,8,8,"Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,21,8,9,Ok.
Ross Geller,Powerful,2,21,8,10,No.
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,21,8,11,No?
Ross Geller,Mad,2,21,8,12,"No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,21,8,13,"Alright, hang on a second there Custer."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,21,8,14,"Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,21,8,15,"Yeah, sure."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,21,8,16,By someone besides Monica?
Ross Geller,Scared,2,21,8,17,"No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,21,8,18,"Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back."
Monica Geller,Scared,2,21,9,2,I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
Rachel Green,Scared,2,21,9,3,What?
Monica Geller,Scared,2,21,9,4,"Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,21,9,5,For what?
Monica Geller,Scared,2,21,9,6,I've gotta get back in the game.
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,21,9,7,"Why, when did you get out of the game?"
Monica Geller,Sad,2,21,9,8,"I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it."
Rachel Green,Sad,2,21,9,9,Oh no.
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,21,9,10,"Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,21,9,11,"Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,21,9,12,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?"
Rachel Green,Scared,2,21,9,13,"I, I don't have it."
Monica Geller,Sad,2,21,9,14,"But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs."
Rachel Green,Sad,2,21,9,15,Nobody does honey.
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,21,12,2,"God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt."
Little Bully,Joyful,2,21,12,3,"Us, what about you guys? Man you really, bing, gave it to old Mr. Clean back there. He was a big guy."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,21,12,4,Yeah he was wasn't he.
Chandler Bing,Sad,2,21,12,5,"Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything."
Big Bully,Scared,2,21,12,6,Don't do that to yourself. Any one of us could have tripped over that little girls jump-rope.
Ross Geller,Scared,2,21,12,7,"So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?"
Little Bully,Neutral,2,21,12,8,We're ok.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,21,12,9,Alright.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,21,12,10,"Ok so, can I have my hat back?"
Little Bully,Mad,2,21,12,11,No.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,21,12,12,Huh.
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,21,13,2,Look at her.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,21,13,3,Hi Monica.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,21,13,4,"He-he-he, how's it goin'?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,21,13,5,Hey nice boobs.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,21,13,6,"Guys guys, check this out."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,21,13,7,Excellent.
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,22,1,2,"So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon."
#ALL#,Mad,2,22,1,3,Ohhh.
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,22,1,4,What?
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,22,1,5,Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
Monica Geller,Scared,2,22,1,6,You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,22,1,7,Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,22,1,8,Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,22,1,9,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,22,1,10,"Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,22,1,11,"Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,22,1,12,"Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,22,1,13,"Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,22,2,2,"I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,22,2,3,"Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,22,2,4,"Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,22,2,5,Why not her?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,22,2,6,"Cause she uh, she steals stuff."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,22,2,7,Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
Monica Geller,Mad,2,22,2,8,Joey that is horriable.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,22,2,9,"Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,22,2,10,"I'm sorry, I didn't know."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,22,2,11,"I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,22,2,12,"Hi honey, how did it go?"
Rachel Green,Mad,2,22,2,13,"Agh, it was the graduation from hell."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,22,2,14,"Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,22,2,15,"Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,22,2,16,So what happened?
Rachel Green,Mad,2,22,2,17,"My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,22,2,18,"Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,22,2,19,"Well, how bout just her mom?"
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,22,2,20,Why her mom?
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,22,2,21,Cause I already invited her.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,22,2,22,"Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,22,2,23,"Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,22,6,2,"Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor."
Rachel Green,Sad,2,22,6,3,"This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,22,6,4,"Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed."
Rachel Green,Sad,2,22,6,5,"Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,22,6,6,Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,22,6,7,"It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just..."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,22,6,8,"I, I know."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,2,22,7,2,"Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun."
Sandra Green,Peaceful,2,22,7,3,"Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,22,7,4,Ok will do. So glad you came.
Sandra Green,Neutral,2,22,7,5,I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,22,7,6,"Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,22,7,7,Oh ok.
Sandra Green,Joyful,2,22,7,8,Happy birthday sweetie.
Rachel Green,Powerful,2,22,7,9,Ok.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,22,7,10,"Ahh, you drive safe."
Sandra Green,Neutral,2,22,7,11,"Ross, what're you doing."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,22,7,12,I'm getting ready for the water skiing. How are you doing?
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,22,7,13,"Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?"
Leonard Green,Neutral,2,22,7,14,To get my coat.
Guys,Scared,2,22,7,15,No no no.
Leonard Green,Powerful,2,22,7,16,"Alright, alright, I can get my own coat."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,22,7,17,"Sorry, we're on a major flan high."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,22,7,18,"Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe."
Leonard Green,Powerful,2,22,7,19,"I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,22,7,20,"Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,22,7,21,"Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care."
Sandra Green,Joyful,2,22,7,22,"Oh, you kids Well, this is the best party I've been to in years."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,2,22,7,23,Thank you.
Monica Geller,Powerful,2,22,8,2,"Ok everybody, it's time for flan."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,22,8,3,"Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,22,8,4,Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,22,8,5,"Ok, that's enough."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,22,8,6,"Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish."
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,22,8,7,"Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,23,2,2,"Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp."
Richard Burke,Joyful,2,23,2,3,"Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown."
Richard Burke,Powerful,2,23,2,4,"Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,23,2,5,Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,23,2,6,What're you doing?
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,23,2,7,Just waiting for you sweetie.
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,23,2,8,Are you remaking the bed?
Monica Geller,Sad,2,23,2,9,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine."
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,23,2,10,"Then, you're redoing it because..."
Monica Geller,Sad,2,23,2,11,"If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy."
Richard Burke,Scared,2,23,2,12,You're pretty much running that risk either way.
Monica Geller,Sad,2,23,2,13,"Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner."
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,23,2,14,"Oh, well that's not so crazy."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,23,2,15,I'm just easing you in.
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,23,2,16,"Oh, alright."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,2,23,2,17,"Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you."
Richard Burke,Peaceful,2,23,2,18,"Actually, if it's possible, I love you more."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,23,2,19,"Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,23,3,2,"Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,23,3,3,But don't you need experience for a job like that?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,23,3,4,"It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor."
Scott Alexander,Joyful,2,23,3,5,"Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,23,3,6,"Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor."
Scott Alexander,Peaceful,2,23,3,7,No kidding.
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,23,3,8,"Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call."
Scott Alexander,Neutral,2,23,3,9,Where do you work?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,23,3,10,"Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,23,3,11,I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
Scott Alexander,Joyful,2,23,3,12,"Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha..."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,23,3,13,Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,23,4,2,"Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,23,4,3,"You look fabulous honey, you really do."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,23,4,4,"Yeah? Are you sure, really."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,23,4,5,"You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,23,4,6,"I, I, I'm hideous."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,23,4,7,It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,23,5,2,Come in.
Ryan,Peaceful,2,23,5,3,"Hey baby, I'm back..."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,23,5,4,"Hey Ryan, what's up?"
Ryan,Neutral,2,23,5,5,What's goin' on?
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,23,5,6,"Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox."
Ryan,Neutral,2,23,5,7,Chicken or small?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,23,5,8,Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
Ryan,Neutral,2,23,5,9,Why aren't you at home in bed?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,23,5,10,"'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are."
Ryan,Scared,2,23,5,11,"I'm sorry, I never had 'em."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,23,5,12,"Ohh, ohh."
Ryan,Powerful,2,23,5,13,"If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,2,23,5,14,"Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now."
Ryan,Neutral,2,23,5,15,Can I please see your face?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,23,5,16,Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
Ryan,Peaceful,2,23,5,17,"Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,2,23,5,18,"And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary."
Ryan,Peaceful,2,23,5,19,"Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,23,5,20,"I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this."
Ryan,Joyful,2,23,5,21,"Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,23,5,22,"Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,23,6,2,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,23,6,3,"Hey, how's the first day goin'?"
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,23,6,4,Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,23,6,5,Well there you go.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,23,6,6,"Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,23,6,7,"Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,23,6,8,"Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,23,6,9,Weird world. Your kids?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,23,6,10,I figure my character has kids.
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,23,6,11,Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,23,6,12,"Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,23,6,13,"Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,23,6,14,"Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,23,6,15,Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
Ryan,Neutral,2,23,7,2,You know what makes the itching even worse?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,23,7,3,That you don't stop talking about it.
Ryan,Mad,2,23,7,4,Fine.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,23,7,5,"Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go... Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice..."
Ryan,Scared,2,23,7,6,What're you doing? Are you scratching?
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,23,7,7,"No. This is what I do for luck, ok."
Ryan,Powerful,2,23,7,8,You're scratching. Give me the dice.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,23,7,9,No.
Ryan,Powerful,2,23,7,10,Give me the dice.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,23,7,11,"No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes."
Ryan,Neutral,2,23,7,12,"We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,23,7,13,"Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body."
Ryan,Powerful,2,23,7,14,No.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,23,7,15,Give it.
Ryan,Powerful,2,23,7,16,No.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,23,7,17,"Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good."
Ryan,Scared,2,23,7,18,Oh God help me.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,23,7,19,"Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,23,7,20,"Oh, stop that, stop that right now."
Ross Geller,Scared,2,23,7,21,"You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,23,8,2,"You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it."
Jeannie,Joyful,2,23,8,3,"Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,23,8,4,"Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie."
Jeannie,Neutral,2,23,8,5,Bye bye Joey.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,23,8,6,What a phony.
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,23,8,7,"Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,23,8,8,Sir.
Mr. Douglas,Mad,2,23,8,9,"Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,23,8,10,Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
Mr. Douglas,Peaceful,2,23,8,11,"I have a family, I'm gonna be here."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,23,8,12,"Yeah Bing, what's that about?"
Chandler Bing,Powerful,2,23,8,13,"It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday."
Mr. Douglas,Mad,2,23,8,14,Rough numbers?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,23,8,15,This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
Mr. Douglas,Powerful,2,23,8,16,Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,23,8,17,"Uh, if you say so sir."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,23,8,18,"Joseph's good, isn't he?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,23,8,19,"Well, I'm going to kill you."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,23,8,20,"Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,23,8,21,Why?
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,23,8,22,"Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,23,10,2,Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,23,10,3,Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,23,10,4,'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,23,10,5,"Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,23,10,6,"Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,2,23,10,7,"Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,23,10,8,"What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,23,10,9,"I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,23,10,10,"Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,23,10,11,"Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,23,10,12,Karen.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,2,23,10,13,"Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,23,10,14,Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,2,23,10,15,"Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,23,10,16,Really?
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,23,10,17,"No freakshow, she's fictional."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,23,10,18,"Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,2,23,10,19,Thank you.
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,2,23,10,20,"It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,23,11,2,Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,23,11,3,"No sorry hon, Monica's orders."
Ryan,Neutral,2,23,11,4,Well that wasn't easy.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,23,11,5,"Ok, dinner's on."
Rachel Green,Powerful,2,23,11,6,And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,23,11,7,"Alright you kids, bye now."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,23,11,9,"Oh look, a low budget puppet show."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,23,11,10,It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.
Ryan,Neutral,2,23,11,11,Wine?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,23,11,12,Please.
Ryan,Sad,2,23,11,13,"Oh, I spilled some."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,23,11,14,I got it.
Ryan,Joyful,2,23,11,15,"I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,23,11,16,What?
Ryan,Joyful,2,23,11,17,Sorry. You look beautiful.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,23,11,18,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,23,11,19,"You know what, that's it, that's it."
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,23,12,2,"Monica, wake up. Monica."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,23,12,3,What's up?
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,23,12,4,I thought of a thing.
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,23,12,5,Yeah?
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,23,12,6,"Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,23,12,7,No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,23,12,8,Or so I would have you believe.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,2,23,12,9,"No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed."
Richard Burke,Mad,2,23,12,10,"Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,23,12,11,"Alright, go on."
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,23,12,12,"Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,23,12,13,"Oh my God, you're a freak."
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,23,12,14,Yeah. How 'bout that.
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,23,13,2,"So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?"
Ryan,Neutral,2,23,13,3,I really can't say.
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,23,13,4,So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
Ryan,Neutral,2,23,13,5,I can't say.
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,23,13,6,"Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys."
Ryan,Neutral,2,23,13,7,"I'm sorry, but I can't say."
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,23,13,8,"Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines."
Ryan,Neutral,2,23,13,9,"I better get out of here, I'm gonna miss my flight."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,2,23,13,10,"Ok, I'll walk you out."
Ross Geller,Sad,2,23,13,11,Bye Ryan.
Ryan,Neutral,2,23,13,12,Pleasure.
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,23,13,13,It was nice to meet you.
Ryan,Neutral,2,23,13,14,Take care.
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,23,13,15,"So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,23,13,16,You like that do ya?
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,23,13,17,Oh yeah.

Rachel Green,Joyful,2,23,13,19,Ok.
Ryan,Joyful,2,23,13,20,Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,23,13,21,"I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that."
Ryan,Neutral,2,23,13,22,Taxi.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,23,13,23,Bye you.
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,23,14,2,"Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor."

Ross Geller,Neutral,2,23,14,7,"Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,24,1,2,"Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,24,1,3,Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
#ALL#,Neutral,2,24,1,4,Who?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,24,1,5,All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
#ALL#,Joyful,2,24,1,6,Wow!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,2,24,1,7,"Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,24,1,8,'Cause he was just so darn cute.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,24,1,9,"No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,24,1,10,"Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,2,24,1,11,"I did do it, I'm a professional."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,24,1,12,Then what's the problem?
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,2,24,1,13,"See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,24,1,14,"Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,24,2,2,"Hey, what did your agent say?"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,24,2,3,"Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,24,2,4,"What, forget it!"
Rachel Green,Mad,2,24,2,5,"Yeah, right."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,24,2,6,"Come on, I need your help here."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,24,2,7,"All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,2,24,2,8,"You see this, this is a friend."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,2,24,2,9,"Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,2,24,2,10,Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
Monica Geller,Peaceful,2,24,2,11,"Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,2,24,2,12,"Yeah, that makes sense."
Ross Geller,Mad,2,24,2,13,Over my dead body!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,2,24,2,14,And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,24,4,2,"Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is."
Richard Burke,Joyful,2,24,4,3,"Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,24,4,4,"Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure."
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,24,4,5,Okay.
Monica Geller,Scared,2,24,4,6,"Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?"
Richard Burke,Peaceful,2,24,4,7,Sure I do.
Monica Geller,Scared,2,24,4,8,"Yeah, am I in it?"
Richard Burke,Peaceful,2,24,4,9,"Honey, you are in it."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,24,4,10,"Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky."
Richard Burke,Joyful,2,24,4,11,"Oh, yeah!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,24,4,12,Keep talkin'.
Richard Burke,Joyful,2,24,4,13,"Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast."
Monica Geller,Scared,2,24,4,14,"Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?"
Richard Burke,Joyful,2,24,4,15,Like a hound?
Monica Geller,Mad,2,24,4,16,"Not a basset, a bassinet."
Richard Burke,Scared,2,24,4,17,You really need the bassinet?
Monica Geller,Scared,2,24,4,18,"Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future."
Richard Burke,Sad,2,24,4,19,"Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start."
Monica Geller,Sad,2,24,4,20,Uh-huh.
Richard Burke,Peaceful,2,24,4,21,"Look I want you, now."
Monica Geller,Scared,2,24,4,22,"That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,24,7,2,"Hey, there."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,24,7,3,Hi.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,24,7,4,Are you all right?
Rachel Green,Scared,2,24,7,5,"Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,2,24,7,6,"Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,24,7,7,"God I know, you're right."
Wedding Planner,Powerful,2,24,7,8,"All rightie, everybody look at me. Good. All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you."
Rachel Green,Neutral,2,24,7,9,"Okay, I'll see you after the thing."

Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,24,9,3,"Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,24,9,4,What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,2,24,9,5,"Oh, my."
Chandler Bing,Mad,2,24,9,6,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,24,9,7,She wants to meet you in person.
Chandler Bing,Sad,2,24,9,8,"Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,24,9,9,"What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,2,24,9,10,"Okay, I'll do it!"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,2,24,9,11,"Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much."
Monica Geller,Joyful,2,24,10,2,"Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will."
Richard Burke,Neutral,2,24,10,3,"Okay, last chance. Again, I'm sorry."
Monica Geller,Neutral,2,24,10,4,"You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do."
Best Man,Joyful,2,24,10,5,"Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you. I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel..."
#ALL#,Scared,2,24,10,6,What?!

Best Man,Neutral,2,24,10,9,"No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!"
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,24,10,10,"Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that..."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,24,10,11,"Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,24,10,12,"Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend."
Rachel Green,Scared,2,24,10,13,Oh dear God.
Ross Geller,Joyful,2,24,10,14,"Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers."
Rachel Green,Mad,2,24,10,15,She you in the parking lot.
Ross Geller,Scared,2,24,10,16,"No, Rach!"
Barry Farber,Neutral,2,24,10,17,And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,24,10,18,"Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well , I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really left to say except.... ""Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With yellow feathers , feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She would..."""
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,24,10,19,"Marenge,"
Rachel Green,Joyful,2,24,10,20,"""...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."""

Richard Burke,Neutral,2,24,11,2,"Okay, I'll do it."
Monica Geller,Scared,2,24,11,3,You'll do what?
Richard Burke,Powerful,2,24,11,4,If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.

Richard Burke,Peaceful,2,24,11,8,"Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will."
Monica Geller,Mad,2,24,11,9,"You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'"
Richard Burke,Scared,2,24,11,10,But you're not.
Monica Geller,Mad,2,24,11,11,"Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one."
Richard Burke,Peaceful,2,24,11,12,God. I love you.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,2,24,11,13,I know you do. Me too. So what now?
Richard Burke,Peaceful,2,24,11,14,I guess we just keep dancing.
Chandler Bing,Scared,2,24,12,2,"Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,2,24,12,3,"Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,24,12,4,"Ooh, oh, oh, that's her."
Ross Geller,Neutral,2,24,12,5,"Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,2,24,12,6,"Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to..."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,2,24,12,7,Oh my God!
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,2,24,12,8,OH.....MY.....GAWD!!
#ALL#,Joyful,2,24,12,9,OH.....MY.....GOD!!
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,1,2,2,I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,1,2,3,Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,1,2,4,"See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,1,2,5,"What song was that, Pheebs?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,1,2,6,"Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,1,2,8,Hi Monica!
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,1,2,9,Hey Mon!
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,1,2,10,Hey Mon!
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,1,2,12,"Oh my God, has she slept at all?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,1,2,13,Nope.
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,1,2,14,"No, it's been three nights in a row."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,1,2,15,"Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,1,2,16,"Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,1,3,2,Morning.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,1,3,3,"Morning, hey, you made pancakes?"
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,1,3,4,"Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,3,1,3,5,"Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. Good morning Joey."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,1,3,6,Good morning.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,1,3,7,"Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Peaceful,3,1,3,8,"Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer."
Chandler Bing,Sad,3,1,3,9,I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,3,1,3,10,"I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,1,3,11,"Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,1,3,12,Kiss her! Kiss her!
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,3,1,3,13,"I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,1,3,14,B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,1,3,15,"Nope, not this time."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,1,3,16,"Come on, quite yankin' me."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,1,3,17,I'm not yanking you.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,1,3,18,This is Janice.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,1,3,19,"Yeah, I know. She makes me happy."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,1,3,20,"Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,1,3,21,I'm not breaking up with her!
Monica Geller,Scared,3,1,4,2,"God, look what I found in the drain."
Rachel Green,Scared,3,1,4,3,What?!
Monica Geller,Scared,3,1,4,4,It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this?
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,1,4,5,Getting it away from me would be job one.
Monica Geller,Scared,3,1,4,6,"It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,1,4,7,"Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal."
Monica Geller,Sad,3,1,4,8,"God, what is wrong with me."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,1,4,9,You need to get some sleep.
Monica Geller,Sad,3,1,4,10,I need to get some Richard.
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,1,4,11,"Monica, you broke up with him for a reason."
Monica Geller,Sad,3,1,4,12,"I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,1,4,13,"Maybe, because you told him not to."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,1,4,14,What are you the memory woman?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,1,4,15,Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,1,4,16,"Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,1,4,17,Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,1,4,18,"Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,1,4,19,There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,1,4,20,"Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,1,4,21,"Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,1,5,2,"Honey, I was wondering...."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,1,5,3,Hmm?
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,1,5,4,"Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?"
Ross Geller,Sad,3,1,5,5,"Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,1,5,6,Hmm.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,1,5,7,I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,1,5,8,"You remember not having sex in high school, right?"
Ross Geller,Sad,3,1,5,9,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Sad,3,1,5,10,"Well honey, what about you?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,1,5,11,What?
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,1,5,12,"I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,1,5,13,No.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,1,5,14,Come on you gotta have one!
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,1,5,15,Nope.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,1,5,16,"Ross, you know what..."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,1,5,17,What?
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,1,5,18,"...if you tell me, I might do it."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,1,5,19,"Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,1,5,20,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,1,5,21,"Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,1,5,22,Oooh!
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,1,5,23,"Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,1,7,3,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,1,7,4,Wheel!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,1,7,5,Of!
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,1,7,6,Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,1,7,7,"You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,1,7,8,"I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,1,7,9,"No, Janice."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,1,7,10,"Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,1,7,11,"You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,1,7,12,"No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,1,7,13,"Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,1,7,14,"Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,1,7,15,"Well, there you go."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,1,7,16,"Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,1,7,17,"Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,1,7,18,"Look, what do you want me to say?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,1,7,19,I want you to say that you like her!
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,1,7,20,"I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her."
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,1,7,21,"Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,1,7,22,"Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?"
Ross Geller,Scared,3,1,8,2,How could you have told her?
Rachel Green,Mad,3,1,8,3,"Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal."
Ross Geller,Mad,3,1,8,4,"Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal."
Rachel Green,Scared,3,1,8,5,"Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?"
Ross Geller,Mad,3,1,8,6,"Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,1,8,7,"Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff."
Ross Geller,Mad,3,1,8,8,"That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,1,8,9,Were both of those Joey?
Ross Geller,Mad,3,1,8,10,"Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,1,8,11,Not even with your best friend.
Ross Geller,Mad,3,1,8,12,Noo!
Rachel Green,Sad,3,1,8,13,"That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,1,8,14,"Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,1,8,15,Pretty much.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,1,8,16,Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,1,8,17,"Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,1,8,18,"I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,1,9,2,"Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,1,9,3,"Richard's living room, drinking wine."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,1,9,4,"All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!"
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,1,9,5,"I'm sorry, but that's my happy place."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,1,9,6,"Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,1,9,7,"All right, I'll try not to."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,1,9,8,"Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky...."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,1,9,9,Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,1,9,10,"All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees...."
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,1,9,11,"I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,1,9,12,"All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook...."
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,1,9,13,"Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Mad,3,1,10,2,"So, I hear, you hate me!"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,1,10,3,"I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Mad,3,1,10,4,A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,1,10,5,And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
Janice Litman Goralnik,Sad,3,1,10,6,"All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, We've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea you and me spending some quality time together."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,1,10,7,But what does that gonna do...
Janice Litman Goralnik,Powerful,3,1,10,8,For Chandler!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,1,10,9,Okay. I'm in.
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,3,1,10,10,Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!'
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,1,10,11,Does it have to be a whole day?
Janice Litman Goralnik,Peaceful,3,1,10,12,"Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,1,10,13,"Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,3,1,12,2,We're baack!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,1,12,3,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,1,12,4,What are you guys doing together?
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,3,1,12,5,Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,1,12,6,Really.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,1,12,7,"Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,3,1,12,8,"I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,1,12,9,You still can't stand her can you?
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,1,12,10,"I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,1,12,11,"Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,1,12,12,"But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,1,12,13,"Well, I guess that's something."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,1,12,14,"No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,1,12,15,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,1,12,16,"Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross."
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,1,12,17,Oh God!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,1,12,18,"Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,1,12,19,Really?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,1,12,20,"Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,1,13,4,"Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?"
Jack Geller,Peaceful,3,1,13,5,"Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. Since when did you start smoking cigars?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,1,13,6,"I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?"
Jack Geller,Peaceful,3,1,13,7,"Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay."
Monica Geller,Sad,3,1,13,8,What makes you think that I might not be okay?
Jack Geller,Powerful,3,1,13,9,I saw Richard.
Monica Geller,Scared,3,1,13,10,Oh.
Jack Geller,Neutral,3,1,13,11,"So, how are you doing?"
Monica Geller,Sad,3,1,13,12,"I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?"
Jack Geller,Neutral,3,1,13,13,You don't wanna know.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,1,13,14,"No, I really, really do."
Jack Geller,Powerful,3,1,13,15,"Well, he's doing terrible!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,1,13,16,Really!
Jack Geller,Sad,3,1,13,17,Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,1,13,18,You're not just saying that are you?
Jack Geller,Powerful,3,1,13,19,"No, the man is a mess."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,1,13,20,Was he crying?
Jack Geller,Neutral,3,1,13,21,No.
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,1,13,22,"Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?"
Jack Geller,Neutral,3,1,13,23,Maybe.
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,1,13,24,I think so.
Jack Geller,Peaceful,3,1,13,25,"Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However,"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,2,1,2,"All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,2,1,3,Taste it.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,2,1,4,"Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,2,1,5,"Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,2,1,6,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,2,1,7,"Hey, mister tux!"
Ross Geller,Scared,3,2,1,8,Why aren't you guys dressed?
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,2,1,9,We have a half hour.
Ross Geller,Mad,3,2,1,10,"No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,2,1,11,"Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed."
Ross Geller,Mad,3,2,1,12,"Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,2,1,14,"Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,2,1,15,Really.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,2,1,16,"Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,2,1,17,Hi.
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,2,1,18,How come you didn't come over earlier?
Ross Geller,Mad,3,2,1,19,"'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,2,1,20,"Hey, Ross, want some cider?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,2,1,21,"No. So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,2,1,22,"Yeah, I just have to get dressed."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,2,1,23,Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
Rachel Green,Powerful,3,2,1,24,"Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,2,1,25,Glass of fat?
Sherman Whitfield,Neutral,3,2,4,2,"Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,2,4,3,Wow! What a pleasure.
Sherman Whitfield,Joyful,3,2,4,4,"Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,2,4,5,Excuse me. Hi.
Sherman Whitfield,Neutral,3,2,4,6,Yes?
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,2,4,7,"Well, your kind of sitting in my seat."
Sherman Whitfield,Powerful,3,2,4,8,"What do you mean, your seat?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,2,4,9,"I mean, I was sitting there."
Sherman Whitfield,Mad,3,2,4,10,"But, you got up!"
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,2,4,11,"But, I never left the room!"
Sherman Whitfield,Mad,3,2,4,12,"But, you left the chair area."
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,2,4,13,"All right, that's it, give me your underwear."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,3,2,2,"Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,3,2,3,Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,3,2,4,Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,3,2,5,I didn't know there were docks.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,3,2,7,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,3,2,8,Hey.
Ross Geller,Scared,3,3,2,9,"Aww, is it broken?"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,3,2,10,"No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,3,2,11,Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,3,2,12,Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,3,2,13,"Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,3,2,14,What is this? Fruit?
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,3,2,15,Monica's making jam.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,3,2,16,"Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,3,2,17,Because the kids need new shoes.
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,3,2,18,"I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,3,2,19,This will just be my batch.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,3,3,2,"Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you."
Guy,Sad,3,3,3,3,"You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters...."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,3,3,4,What?
Guy,Sad,3,3,3,5,"One more chance Ursula, please?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,3,3,6,"Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward."
Guy,Scared,3,3,3,7,Wh..
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,3,3,8,"Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously."
Guy,Powerful,3,3,3,9,"Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,3,3,10,"Oh, you're not a dingus."
Guy,Sad,3,3,3,11,"I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,3,3,12,"Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay."
Guy,Neutral,3,3,3,13,Well thanks.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,3,3,14,"Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?"
Guy,Scared,3,3,3,15,Not really.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,3,3,16,"Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay."
Guy,Peaceful,3,3,3,17,"Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,3,3,18,"Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?"
Guy,Joyful,3,3,3,19,"Yeah, okay."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,3,3,20,"Okay. Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more."
Guy,Sad,3,3,3,21,Sorry.
Malcom,Neutral,3,3,7,2,Here's my binoculars.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,3,7,3,"Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going."
Malcom,Joyful,3,3,7,4,"These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,3,7,5,"Oh, yeah. What's this?"
Malcom,Sad,3,3,7,6,"Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,3,7,7,"Um, not even a little bit."
Malcom,Scared,3,3,7,8,It's about you.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,3,7,9,"Oh, okay then."
Malcom,Joyful,3,3,7,10,"I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,3,7,11,Good. So what were you thinking?
Malcom,Joyful,3,3,7,12,I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,3,7,13,Really?
Malcom,Mad,3,3,7,14,No.
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,3,7,15,Oh.
Malcom,Powerful,3,3,7,16,"See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,3,7,17,"Oh, okay."
Rachel Green,Scared,3,3,9,2,"Oh my God, what happened?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,Scared,3,3,9,3,"Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!"
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,3,9,4,Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,3,3,9,5,"Oh, I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,3,9,6,Ross's what?
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,3,3,9,7,"You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God."
Malcom,Scared,3,3,10,2,Phoebe?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,3,10,3,Yes? Yes! Oh.
Malcom,Neutral,3,3,10,4,What are you doing?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,3,10,5,"Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh."
Malcom,Scared,3,3,10,6,Were you following me?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,3,10,7,"Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister."
Malcom,Scared,3,3,10,8,So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,3,10,9,"Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?"
Malcom,Sad,3,3,10,10,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,3,10,11,"No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch."
Malcom,Scared,3,3,10,12,"Uh-huh, I don't know."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,3,10,13,"Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,3,12,2,"I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it Maybe if they met me in person."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,3,12,3,"Honey, you got a little thing on your..."

Ross Geller,Scared,3,3,12,8,"Hey. Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,3,12,9,Sure. What's up?
Ross Geller,Mad,3,3,12,10,"Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!"
Host,Joyful,3,4,1,2,"Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,4,1,3,"Oh, oh! It's on again!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,4,1,4,"You guys, can we please not watch this all right."
#ALL#,Sad,3,4,1,5,Shhhh!
Host,Powerful,3,4,1,6,"Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,4,1,7,"Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!"
Mike,Neutral,3,4,1,8,And there is Kevin.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,4,1,9,Can we please turn this off?
Rachel Green,Scared,3,4,1,10,"Noo way, Kevin."
Mike,Joyful,3,4,1,11,There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,4,1,12,Are you intrigued?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,4,1,13,You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
Mike,Powerful,3,4,1,14,"Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,4,1,15,"Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,4,4,2,"Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,4,4,3,"Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,4,4,4,"Come on baby, come on!"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,4,4,5,"'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'"
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,4,4,6,Very nice touch.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,4,4,7,"'Okay, go ahead.' Um, hi Annie. Fantastic! You got it. Oh, okay, um, 'Will he work for scale?' you ask me. Well, I don't know about that, except that I do and he will. Great, oh you are such a sweetheart. I would love to have lunch with you, how about we have lunch next.... Op, went through a tunnel."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,4,4,8,Unbelievable.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,4,4,9,Thank you so much.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,4,4,10,"It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,4,4,11,"You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,4,4,12,"Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,4,4,13,"Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,4,4,14,Two?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,4,4,15,"Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,4,4,16,"Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,4,4,17,"Nooo, four."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Neutral,3,4,5,2,"So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,4,5,3,"'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,3,4,5,4,"Ohhh, are you a puppy! Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,4,5,5,"Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer. See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Neutral,3,4,5,6,"Oh, you didn't have to do this."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,4,5,7,"Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,3,4,5,8,"Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,4,5,9,"Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Neutral,3,4,5,10,We should?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,4,5,11,"Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,3,4,5,12,"I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,4,5,13,"I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Neutral,3,4,5,14,You probably want us to move in together?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,4,5,15,It doesn't scare me!
Janice Litman Goralnik,Scared,3,4,5,16,"Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um..."
Chandler Bing,Sad,3,4,5,17,"Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!! Hey, Janice! It's me. Um, yeah, I-I-I just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,4,6,2,"Honey, this will help."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,4,6,3,"So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down."
Monica Geller,Sad,3,4,6,5,That is never good.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,4,6,6,Then I got all needy and clingy.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,4,6,7,"Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,4,6,8,She said she'd call me.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,4,6,10,Oh God.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,4,6,11,Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,4,6,12,This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,4,6,13,"Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases."
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,4,6,14,"You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,4,6,15,"Yeah, you do."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,4,6,16,"So, you don't think I'm terminal?"
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,4,6,17,"Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,4,6,18,"Okay, okay. So, should I call her?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,4,6,20,"This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,4,6,21,She has to know that your not ready.
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,4,6,22,"Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,4,6,23,"So I'm not, not gonna lose her?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,4,6,24,"Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,4,6,25,"I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,4,6,26,Oh.
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,4,7,2,"Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben. 'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,4,7,3,G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,4,7,4,G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
Ross Geller,Powerful,3,4,7,5,"Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,4,7,7,Helloo! Oh!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,4,7,8,Pheebs! There you are!
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,4,7,9,"No it's not, sorry."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,4,7,10,"But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,4,7,11,"Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,4,7,12,"Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,4,7,13,"Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,4,7,14,"It's okay, these things happen."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,4,7,15,"But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,4,7,16,"I'm, I'm okay. See."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,4,7,17,"Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,4,7,18,"No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,4,7,19,"Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,4,7,20,They actually said that?
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,4,7,21,"Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I..."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,4,7,22,"No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,4,7,23,"Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,4,7,24,"You'll never get me, Joe!!!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,Neutral,3,4,8,2,"No, thank you. Chandler!"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,4,8,3,"Hello, Janice."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Mad,3,4,8,4,What are you doing here?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,4,8,5,"Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,Sad,3,4,8,6,Are you being British?!
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,4,8,7,No. Not anymore.
Janice Litman Goralnik,Scared,3,4,8,8,Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,4,8,9,"Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Mad,3,4,8,10,Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,4,8,11,"Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Mad,3,4,8,12,Where is this party?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,4,8,13,Here in Chelsea.
Janice Litman Goralnik,Neutral,3,4,8,14,Who's party is it?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,4,8,15,A woman's
Janice Litman Goralnik,Mad,3,4,8,16,What woman?!
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,4,8,17,Chelsea.
Janice Litman Goralnik,Mad,3,4,8,18,"Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,4,8,19,Can I be that guy?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,4,9,2,"Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,4,9,3,"Okay, shoot."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,4,9,4,"Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,4,9,5,I didn't get it?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,4,9,6,"No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,4,9,7,"Okay, what else?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,4,9,8,"Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,4,9,9,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,4,9,10,"Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,4,9,11,"Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,4,9,12,Oh.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,4,9,13,"Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,4,9,14,"Yeah, no, I understand."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,4,9,15,"You do, thanks."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,4,9,16,Yeah. Sorry.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,4,9,17,Wait a minute.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,4,9,18,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,4,9,19,"Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,4,9,20,"Oh, you caught me. I am so busted."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,4,9,21,That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
Chandler Bing,Sad,3,4,10,2,"....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,4,10,3,"My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'."
Chandler Bing,Sad,3,4,10,4,"I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,4,10,5,"Yeah, it is."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,4,10,6,"You know what, everything's gonna be okay."
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,4,10,8,"Hello. Hi, Janice! Can you hold on for a second? Okay. Okay, what do I do?"
Rachel Green,Scared,3,4,10,9,"Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,4,10,10,If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,4,10,11,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,4,10,12,Hello!
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,4,10,13,"Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,4,10,14,"Yes, and grumpy."
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,4,10,15,"What are you, stop naming dwarves! Hello, Janice. Hi, I'm so glad that you called, I know I've been acting a really weird lately. And, it's just because I'm crazy about you, and I just got...stupid, and, and scared, and....stupid a couple of more times. I'm sorry. Really?! Really?!"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,4,10,16,"He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,4,10,17,I love you too.
Monica Geller,Sad,3,4,10,18,"Aw, it's soo unfair."
Carol Willick,Mad,3,4,11,2,G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!
Ross Geller,Powerful,3,4,11,3,"Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose."
Susan Bunch,Mad,3,4,11,4,"What'd you do, dip it in sugar?"
Ross Geller,Mad,3,4,11,5,"Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'"
Monica Geller,Mad,3,4,11,6,"What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,4,11,7,What?
Monica Geller,Mad,3,4,11,8,"Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,4,11,9,What are you talking about?
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,4,11,10,"The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag."
Ross Geller,Mad,3,4,11,11,"Okay, you are totally making this up."
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,4,11,12,How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.
Ross Geller,Scared,3,4,11,13,Oh God.
Susan Bunch,Joyful,3,4,11,14,I've literally never been this happy.
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,4,11,15,Wasn't there a little song?
Carol Willick,Joyful,3,4,11,16,"Oh please God, let there be a song."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,4,11,17,There was no song. There was no song!
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,4,11,18,'I am Bea.'
Ross Geller,Mad,3,4,11,19,Okay.
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,4,11,20,'I drink tea.'
Ross Geller,Scared,3,4,11,21,"Okay, that's, that's enough."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,4,11,22,"'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '"
Ross Geller,Scared,3,4,11,23,Won't you dance around with me.
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,4,11,24,A-ha!!!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,5,1,2,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,5,1,3,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,5,1,4,Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,5,1,5,No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,5,1,6,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,5,1,7,"Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,5,1,8,You're building a post office?
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,5,1,9,"No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max."
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,5,1,10,Okay. My word! Those are snug.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,5,1,11,"Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,5,1,13,Power saw kinda got away from me there.
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,5,2,2,Hey Pheebs.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,5,2,3,Hey!
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,5,2,4,Any sign of your brother?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,5,2,5,"No, but he's always late."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,5,2,6,I thought you only met him once?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,5,2,7,"Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,5,2,8,"Well relax, he'll be here."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,5,2,9,"No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,5,2,10,"Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,5,4,2,"Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,5,4,3,"No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,5,4,4,"Calm down, do you want this unit or not?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,5,4,5,I do NOT want this unit!!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,5,4,6,"Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's."

Monica Geller,Scared,3,5,5,4,"Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?"
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,5,5,5,"Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all."
Monica Geller,Sad,3,5,5,6,I highly doubt that.

Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,5,5,11,"Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,5,5,12,I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,5,5,14,Eh! There you go.
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,5,5,15,"You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,5,6,2,"Oh, ew!"
Frank Buffay Jr.,Powerful,3,5,6,3,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,5,6,4,"Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad."

Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,5,7,7,"All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,5,7,8,"Okay, Elizabeth Hurely...."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,5,7,9,"Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,5,7,10,Susan Sarandon.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,5,7,11,"Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,5,7,12,And!! Isabella Rosselini.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,5,7,13,"Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,5,7,14,So?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,5,7,15,"So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time."
Rachel Green,Powerful,3,5,7,16,"Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography."

Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,5,9,4,So how's it going with you guys?
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,5,9,5,"So far, it kinda blows. I don't know, I just thought y'know that he'd feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and...."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,5,9,6,"Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head."

Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,5,9,13,I don't have time for this.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,5,9,14,"No, that is what the game is."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,5,9,15,Which you just gave up really quickly.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,5,9,16,Have you seen Joey?
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,5,9,17,What's the matter?
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,5,9,18,"Oh, just this! Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,5,9,19,"Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,5,9,20,What's going on?
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,5,9,21,He's retiling my floor.

Frank Buffay Jr.,Scared,3,5,10,12,"Well, I don't think this, y'know."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,5,10,13,"No, no, no, I wouldn't do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I'll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,Joyful,3,5,10,14,"Yeah! Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?"

Ross Geller,Sad,3,5,11,13,"Hey, it's my list."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,5,11,14,"Okay honey, you do realize she only spins like that on ice."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,5,13,2,"Okay, on three. One....Two...."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,5,13,3,Why don't we just go on two.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,5,13,4,Why two?
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,5,13,5,Because it's faster.
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,5,13,6,"Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk."
Rachel Green,Powerful,3,5,13,7,Oh!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,5,13,8,"All right, but in the future..."

Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,5,13,16,"Wow, it's big!"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,5,13,17,"Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,5,13,18,"Maybe, my ruler's wrong."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,5,13,19,Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,5,13,20,"Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door."
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,5,13,21,"Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,5,13,22,"Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,5,15,2,Y'know what?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,5,15,3,Umm?
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,5,15,4,I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there.

Janice Litman Goralnik,Neutral,3,6,1,2,Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,6,1,3,"Wow, it's like a dirty math problem."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,6,1,4,I'm sorry the answer there would be...none of us.
Janice Litman Goralnik,Powerful,3,6,1,5,"Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,6,1,6,"Well, that's really a different question."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Mad,3,6,1,7,I'm sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,6,1,8,"Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,6,1,10,"Excuse me, there was no time!"
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,6,1,11,"Okay, but let's say there was. How might that go?"
Janice Litman Goralnik,Neutral,3,6,1,12,"Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?"

Eric (photographer),Neutral,3,6,3,3,"Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that's cool."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,6,3,4,"Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never."
Eric (photographer),Powerful,3,6,3,5,"Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she's a porn star."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,6,3,6,"Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you're chances are pretty good. All right."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,6,4,2,"Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,6,4,3,"Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?"

Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,6,4,5,"Well, ah, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don't worry I'm totally okay with the gay thing."
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,6,4,6,What gay thing?
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,6,4,7,"Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I'm totally cool with that."

Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,6,7,3,So what are they doing?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,6,7,4,"I don't know, something girlie."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,6,7,5,"Hey, you're early."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,6,7,6,What are you doing with the lamp?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,6,7,7,I'm just taking it to be re-wired.
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,6,7,8,"Oh, well don't take it to the same place you took the stereo, 'cause they've had that thing for over a week."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,6,7,10,"No, no, Mr. Heckles no one is making any noise up here."
Mr. Heckles,Mad,3,6,7,11,You're disturbing my oboe practice.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,6,7,12,You don't play the oboe!
Mr. Heckles,Mad,3,6,7,13,I could play the oboe!
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,6,7,14,Then I'm gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
Mr. Heckles,Scared,3,6,7,16,Who are you?
Eric (photographer),Peaceful,3,6,7,17,"Hi, I'm Eric, I'm gonna be Chandler's new roommate."
Mr. Heckles,Peaceful,3,6,7,18,I'm Chandler's new roommate.
Eric (photographer),Powerful,3,6,7,19,I-I-I don't think so.
Mr. Heckles,Mad,3,6,7,20,I could be Chandler's new roommate.
Eric (photographer),Scared,3,6,7,21,"But, he told me over the phone."
Mr. Heckles,Powerful,3,6,7,22,He told me in person.
Eric (photographer),Scared,3,6,7,23,That's weird.
Mr. Heckles,Joyful,3,6,7,24,"Well, I'm going to go into my new apartment now. Ehh!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,6,8,2,"Hi, again."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,6,8,3,Hey!

Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,6,8,9,"Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!"
Monica Geller,Scared,3,6,8,10,Whoa! Are you okay?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,6,8,11,"Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,6,8,12,It's the heat. And-and the humidity.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,6,8,13,"That's a uh, that's a tough combination."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,6,8,14,Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,6,8,15,Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,6,8,16,Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,6,8,17,Gotcha.
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,6,8,18,"This place is really my Grandmother's. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,6,8,19,"Oh, you bet I am!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,6,8,20,"Okay, here's your penis!"
Monica Geller,Scared,3,6,9,2,Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,6,9,3,"You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?"
Monica Geller,Mad,3,6,9,4,So?!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,6,9,5,"Whoa, ah!! We're you just gonna give me some lemonade?"
Monica Geller,Scared,3,6,9,6,Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,6,9,7,"Oh right, right."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,6,9,8,"I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,6,9,9,"Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,6,9,10,"It's okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,6,10,2,Pheebs?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,6,10,3,Huh?
Monica Geller,Scared,3,6,10,4,Where's your bed?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,6,10,5,It's not in the apartment? Oh no. I can't believe this is happening again.
Monica Geller,Scared,3,6,10,6,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,6,10,7,"Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I've, I don't live here anymore."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,6,10,8,What are you talking about?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,6,10,9,"I'm sorry, I-I-I-I don't live here anymore. I-I didn't know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!"
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,6,10,10,Everybody knows!
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,6,10,11,"That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn't sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,6,10,12,"Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,6,10,13,"Yeah, I would've except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,6,10,14,What?!?!
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,6,10,15,"Okay, this is what I'm talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill."
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,6,10,16,You can spill. In the sink.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,6,10,17,"Aw, honey it's not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don't see that happening."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,6,10,18,"I love you, too."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,6,10,19,"Aww, good. What?"
Monica Geller,Scared,3,6,10,20,What? I'm just said.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,6,10,21,"No you're not, you're wondering which cushion it is."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,6,11,2,"So ah, whatcha watching?"
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,6,11,3,Baywatch.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,6,11,4,What's it about?

Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,6,11,10,"They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,6,11,11,"Yeah, I'll go get one."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,6,11,12,"No, no, no, don't get up, I got a cooler right here."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,6,12,2,"Well, hello!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,6,12,3,Hey.

Monica Geller,Sad,3,6,12,5,Help yourself.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,6,12,6,You okay?
Monica Geller,Sad,3,6,12,7,Phoebe moved out.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,6,12,8,Right.
Monica Geller,Sad,3,6,12,9,"I don't understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don't have a boyfriend?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,6,12,10,"Noo!! You don't have a boyfriend because....I don't, I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend."
Monica Geller,Sad,3,6,12,11,"Well, I think so."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,6,12,12,"Oh-ho, come here. Listen, you are one of my favourite people and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life."
Ross Geller,Sad,3,6,13,2,Hi. Where is everybody?
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,6,13,3,"Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?"
Ross Geller,Sad,3,6,13,4,"My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,6,13,5,Oh no! Why?
Ross Geller,Mad,3,6,13,6,"'Cause Carol's a lesbian. And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,6,13,7,"Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny."
Ross Geller,Sad,3,6,13,8,"I'm an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,6,13,9,"Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?"
Ross Geller,Mad,3,6,13,10,"Well, now I do!!"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,6,13,11,I'm sorry.
Ross Geller,Powerful,3,6,13,12,"Seven years. I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever...."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,6,13,13,"Aw, God Ross. Oh."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,6,14,2,"Umm, this is nice."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,6,14,3,"I know, it is isn't it?"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,6,14,4,"No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,6,14,5,"Yeah! And I got it on sale, too."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,6,14,6,"Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device."

Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,7,1,3,I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,7,1,4,"Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?"

Chandler Bing,Mad,3,7,2,11,What a wank!
Janice Litman Goralnik,Mad,3,7,2,12,"Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,7,2,13,"I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way."
Matress King,Joyful,3,7,2,14,I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,7,4,2,"Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,7,4,3,Not at these prices.

Ross Geller,Joyful,3,7,7,12,"Yeah, if you're really hungry. It was a joke, I made a joke."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,7,7,13,"Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster."
Leonard Green,Joyful,3,7,7,14,What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,7,7,15,It's not a library...
Leonard Green,Neutral,3,7,7,16,"I know!! It's a museum! What, you're the only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,7,9,2,"Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed."
Student,Neutral,3,7,9,3,"Hey, Mr. Trib."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,7,9,4,Hey-hey.
Student,Joyful,3,7,9,5,"Guess what, I got an audition!"
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,7,9,6,"Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud."
Student,Peaceful,3,7,9,7,I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,7,9,8,You bet! What's the part?
Student,Neutral,3,7,9,9,"Oh it's great, it's a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,7,10,2,"You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,7,10,3,Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
Rachel Green,Mad,3,7,10,4,"Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,7,10,5,"Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,7,10,7,"Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,7,10,8,"I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,7,10,9,Um. yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,7,10,10,I am soo dead.
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,7,10,11,"All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,7,10,12,"Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,7,10,13,"Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,7,10,14,"Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'"
Rachel Green,Sad,3,7,10,15,"Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?"
Ross Geller,Sad,3,7,10,16,"Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along."
Rachel Green,Sad,3,7,10,17,"Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!"
Ross Geller,Sad,3,7,10,18,"Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels."

Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,7,11,10,"I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it..."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,7,11,11,When did I sign for it?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,7,11,12,"When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,7,11,13,Did you make brownies today?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,7,11,14,"Knock, knock."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,7,11,15,"Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed."
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,7,11,16,"Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,7,11,17,It's Monica's bed. What?
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,7,11,18,Okay. It's a racecar.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,7,11,19,"So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?"
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,7,11,20,"Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?"
Monica Geller,Scared,3,7,11,21,Sometimes I have bad dreams.
Student,Scared,3,7,12,2,"Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,7,12,3,Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
Student,Neutral,3,7,12,4,No.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,7,12,5,Whoa. That was really good.

Chandler Bing,Mad,3,7,13,2,You told him to play the boxer gay!!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,7,13,3,"Well, I-I might've said supergay."
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,7,13,4,You totally screwed him over.
Monica Geller,Mad,3,7,13,5,"Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?"
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,7,13,6,"Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,7,13,7,"Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay."
Jester,Neutral,3,7,16,2,"Uh, may I help you?"
Monica Geller,Mad,3,7,16,3,"Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed."
Jester,Mad,3,7,16,4,"Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,7,16,5,"All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king."
Jester,Mad,3,7,16,6,Nobody sees the king!
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,7,16,7,"Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king."
Jester,Mad,3,7,16,8,Hey! You can't go back there!
Janice Litman Goralnik,Scared,3,7,16,10,Oh my God.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,8,1,2,Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,8,1,3,I will have one.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,8,1,5,"Okay, I'm not gonna have one."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,8,1,6,Neither will I.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,8,1,7,"No, no, it's just my tooth."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,8,1,8,All right I'll have one.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,8,1,9,"So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,8,1,10,"No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,8,1,11,See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Ross Geller,Scared,3,8,1,12,Why? Why can't you go to him?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,8,1,13,"Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies."
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,8,1,14,"That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse."
Rachel Green,Scared,3,8,1,15,"Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,8,1,16,"Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'."
Rachel Green,Scared,3,8,1,17,And all these people actually died?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,8,1,18,"Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!"
Ross Geller,Powerful,3,8,1,19,"Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,8,1,20,"Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,8,2,2,"Thanks, Gunther. Hey! Umm, can I get a napkin too?"
Gunther,Neutral,3,8,2,3,"Oh, like you don't already have everything."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,8,2,4,Ow! Ow!
Rachel Green,Sad,3,8,2,5,"Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,8,2,6,"All right, fine, fine, but if you're my next victim, don't come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,8,2,7,I promise.
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,8,2,8,"Although, don't feel like you can't visit."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,8,2,9,"Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,8,2,10,"No, no he's not."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,8,2,11,"You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,8,2,12,"What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,8,2,13,"Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,8,2,14,"Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,8,2,15,"It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,8,2,16,"Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,8,3,2,Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,8,3,3,"Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,8,3,4,"Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,8,3,5,What did they do?
Ross Geller,Mad,3,8,3,6,"Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,8,3,7,"So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?"
Ross Geller,Powerful,3,8,3,8,"Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you."
Rachel Green,Scared,3,8,3,9,Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
Ross Geller,Scared,3,8,3,10,"You? You! Want to watch Ben? Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,8,3,11,"Hey-hey, Ross?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,8,3,12,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,8,3,13,I've got a science question.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,8,3,14,Hmm?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,8,3,15,"If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct?"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,8,3,16,"Joey, Homo Sapiens are people."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,8,3,17,"Hey-hey, I'm not judging."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,8,5,2,"Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,8,5,3,I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,8,5,4,"Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,8,5,5,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,8,5,6,"That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,8,5,7,"Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,8,5,8,"All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,8,5,9,"No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,8,5,10,Why not?!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,8,5,11,"Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is..."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,8,5,12,What is the thing?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,8,5,13,"Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband."
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,8,5,14,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,8,5,15,They were in his office.
Chandler Bing,Sad,3,8,5,16,"Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,8,5,17,"I'm telling you man, I saw it."
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,8,5,18,"Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,8,5,19,"I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?"
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,8,6,2,It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,8,6,3,Right.
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,8,6,4,"Besides, it takes the focus off the hat."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,8,6,5,No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,8,6,6,"See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I?"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,8,6,7,"Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know."

See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?"
Rachel Green,Scared,3,8,6,19,"Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now."
Monica Geller,Sad,3,8,6,20,You okay?
Rachel Green,Powerful,3,8,6,21,"Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it."

Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,8,9,9,I talked to Janice.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,8,9,10,"Oh my God, is she going back to him?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,8,9,11,"She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,8,9,12,"What are you ah, what are you gonna do?"
Chandler Bing,Sad,3,8,9,13,"I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?"

Ross Geller,Scared,3,8,10,2,"Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?"
Rachel Green,Scared,3,8,10,3,"Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child."
Ross Geller,Powerful,3,8,10,4,"It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could."
Rachel Green,Powerful,3,8,10,5,I did!
Ross Geller,Powerful,3,8,10,6,I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
Rachel Green,Powerful,3,8,10,7,I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!

Ross Geller,Scared,3,8,10,14,"Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,8,10,15,Really?!
Ross Geller,Scared,3,8,10,16,"Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know..."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,8,10,17,"Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!"
Rachel Green,Mad,3,8,10,18,I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
Monica Geller,Mad,3,8,10,19,You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,8,10,20,Monica bang! Monica bang! Ow!

Chandler Bing,Scared,3,8,11,2,"Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Neutral,3,8,11,3,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,8,11,4,"I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Scared,3,8,11,5,Wow!
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,8,11,6,"Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Sad,3,8,11,7,"Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say 'good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together."
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,8,11,8,Then don't leave me!
Janice Litman Goralnik,Scared,3,8,11,9,What?
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,8,11,10,"Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,Sad,3,8,11,11,"No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I've got to give my marriage another chance."
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,8,11,12,"No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Sad,3,8,11,13,I'm sorry.
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,8,11,14,Ohhh. Don't go.
Janice Litman Goralnik,Scared,3,8,11,15,"No, I-I-I gotta go."
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,8,11,16,No. No! No! No!
Janice Litman Goralnik,Peaceful,3,8,11,17,"Honey, honey, people are looking."
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,8,11,18,I don't care! I don't care!!
Janice Litman Goralnik,Powerful,3,8,11,19,"Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now."
Chandler Bing,Sad,3,8,11,20,You can't leave! I have your shoe!
Janice Litman Goralnik,Sad,3,8,11,21,Good-bye Chandler Bing.
Gunther,Neutral,3,8,11,22,Rachel has those in burgendy.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,8,12,2,"All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,8,12,3,"Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,8,12,4,I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,8,12,5,"All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window Thread the needle. Thread the needle."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,8,12,7,He's alive! He's a-live!!!
Monica Geller,Scared,3,8,12,8,"And yet, we're still poking him."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,8,12,9,"Okay, retract the device, retract the device."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,8,12,10,He does not look happy.
Rachel Green,Scared,3,8,12,11,"Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,8,12,12,"Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!"
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,8,13,2,I'll hold you close in my arms. I can't resist your charms. And love....
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,8,13,3,Love....
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,8,13,5,No you know I don't mind.

Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,9,1,3,"Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help."
The Guys,Peaceful,3,9,1,4,We will.
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,9,1,5,"Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,9,1,6,"No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,9,1,8,Every year.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,9,5,2,We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there's a like league we could join or something.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,9,5,3,Isn't there a national football league.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,9,5,4,"Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights."
Rachel Green,Sad,3,9,5,5,Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,9,5,6,"Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,9,5,7,"When they're hungry enough, they'll come in."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,9,6,2,Let go!
Ross Geller,Mad,3,9,6,3,No! You let go!
Monica Geller,Mad,3,9,6,4,No!
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,9,6,5,How come it's always us left in the field holding the ball?
Monica Geller,Mad,3,9,6,6,I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,9,6,8,Hey! It's starting to snow.
Ross Geller,Mad,3,9,6,10,Gimme the this!
Monica Geller,Mad,3,9,6,11,Let go!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,10,1,2,"Eh..., I don't, I don't know."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,10,1,3,What?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,10,1,4,"Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?"
Gunther,Neutral,3,10,1,5,Rachel?
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,10,1,6,Yeah.
Gunther,Neutral,3,10,1,7,"Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,10,1,8,"Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?"
Gunther,Powerful,3,10,1,9,"Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,10,1,10,"Eh, do you believe that?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,10,1,11,Yeah?
Sarah Tuttle,Neutral,3,10,2,2,"So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,10,2,3,"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,10,2,4,"Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,10,2,5,Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,10,2,6,I was shrieking... like a Marine.
Ross Geller,Powerful,3,10,2,8,All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
Monica Geller,Mad,3,10,3,2,You broke a little girl's leg?!!
Ross Geller,Sad,3,10,3,3,I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,10,3,4,Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were around ten-ish?
Ross Geller,Scared,3,10,3,5,"Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?"
Monica Geller,Mad,3,10,3,6,"Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk..."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,10,3,8,I'm gonna get back to retraining.
Ross Geller,Sad,3,10,3,9,"All right, see you guys."
Chandler Bing,Sad,3,10,3,10,"Look out kids, he's coming!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,10,3,11,And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,10,3,12,"Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,10,3,13,What? Me having a job?
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,10,3,14,"No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,10,3,15,"Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,10,3,16,Really?
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,10,3,18,"Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York."
Gunther,Neutral,3,10,3,20,"...and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray...."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,10,3,21,"Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there."
Gunther,Mad,3,10,3,22,What if you put them here.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,10,3,23,"Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too."
Gunther,Neutral,3,10,3,24,They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.'
Rachel Green,Sad,3,10,3,25,"Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry."
Gunther,Peaceful,3,10,3,26,It's all right. Sweetheart.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,10,4,2,"So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore."
Sarah Tuttle,Joyful,3,10,4,3,"Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,10,4,4,"Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?"
Sarah Tuttle,Joyful,3,10,4,5,"Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,10,4,6,I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
Sarah Tuttle,Powerful,3,10,4,7,"No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,10,4,8,"Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?"
Sarah Tuttle,Neutral,3,10,4,9,The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,10,4,10,Yeah.
Sarah Tuttle,Neutral,3,10,4,11,"So far, I've sold seventy-five."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,10,4,12,"Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. How much are the boxes?"
Sarah Tuttle,Joyful,3,10,4,13,Five dollars a box.
Ross Geller,Scared,3,10,4,14,And what is second prize?
Sarah Tuttle,Powerful,3,10,4,15,"A ten speed bike. But, I'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,10,4,16,"Well, that makes sense."
Sarah Tuttle,Neutral,3,10,4,17,"Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble?"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,10,4,18,"Yeah, Sarah, anything."
Sarah Tuttle,Sad,3,10,4,19,"Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don't have a TV, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up to a window, so I could watch it."
Woman,Scared,3,10,5,2,Yesss?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,10,5,3,"Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies."
Woman,Scared,3,10,5,4,"You're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,10,5,5,"No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird"
Woman,Scared,3,10,5,6,What does that mean?
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,10,5,7,"Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs."
Woman,Mad,3,10,5,8,"I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!"
Ross Geller,Scared,3,10,5,9,"No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world."
Woman,Mad,3,10,5,10,"I'm pressing, a policeman is on his way."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,10,5,11,"Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going."
Woman,Mad,3,10,5,12,I can still see you!
Ross Geller,Mad,3,10,5,13,All right!!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,10,6,2,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,10,6,3,"Hey. What, what are you doing here?"
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,10,6,4,"Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh..."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,10,6,5,"Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas...."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,10,6,6,Destiny.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,10,6,7,Sure.

Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,10,6,9,All right.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,10,6,10,Okay. Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,10,6,11,"Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,10,6,12,"You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,10,6,13,Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,10,6,14,"So, what happens to the old guys?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,10,6,15,"Well, they go into the chipper."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,10,6,16,"Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!!"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,10,6,17,Hey! Hey!!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,10,9,2,"Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell."
Guy,Joyful,3,10,9,3,Looks good. I'll take it.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,10,9,4,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one."
Guy,Mad,3,10,9,5,It's-it's-it's almost dead!
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,10,9,6,"Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,10,9,7,"Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper."
Guy,Scared,3,10,9,8,I-I think I'm gonna look around a little bit more.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,10,9,9,"Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,10,9,10,"Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,10,9,11,"Well look no further, this one's yours! Ahhh."
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,10,9,12,Is this the one that I threw out last year?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,10,9,13,"All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get so emotional, I guess it's just the holidays, it's hard."
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,10,9,14,"Oh honey, is that 'cause your Mom died around Christmas?"
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,10,9,15,"Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that."
Monica Geller,Sad,3,10,9,16,Oh.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,10,10,2,"Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?"
Girl,Mad,3,10,10,3,I'm not gonna tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,10,10,4,"Hey now! That was an accident, okay."
Girl,Mad,3,10,10,5,You're a big scrud.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,10,10,6,What's a scrud?
Girl,Mad,3,10,10,7,"Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,10,10,8,I don't have too. I can just look at you.
Leader,Neutral,3,10,10,9,"All right girls, and man. Let's see your final tallies. Ohhhh, Debbie, 321 boxes of cookies, Very nice."

Ross Geller,Scared,3,10,10,18,"Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,10,11,2,"Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross."
Ross Geller,Sad,3,10,11,3,"Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,10,11,4,Hey! How'd the interview go?
Rachel Green,Sad,3,10,11,5,"Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,10,11,6,"Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,10,11,7,This is the worst Christmas ever.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,10,11,8,"Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house."
Rachel Green,Sad,3,10,11,9,"I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,10,11,10,That word was swans.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,10,12,2,"Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,10,12,4,Oh! Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,10,12,6,"You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!"

Ross Geller,Joyful,3,10,15,2,"I'm, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Spacecamp, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle's Private Very Special Spacecamp!!"
Sarah Tuttle,Scared,3,10,15,3,"Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,10,15,4,Oh come on! Here we go! Stand by for mission countdown!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,10,15,5,"Ten, ten.., nine, nine, nine...., eight, eight, eight... Okay, Blast off!"

Ross Geller,Joyful,3,10,15,8,Oh no! An asteroid!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,11,1,2,"Okay, pick a card, any card. All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,11,1,3,Um-mm.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,11,1,4,"All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts."

Monica Geller,Neutral,3,11,1,8,"Wow. Joey, how do you do it?"
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,11,1,9,"I can't tell you that, no."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,11,1,11,"Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,11,1,12,"Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,11,1,13,"He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,11,1,14,"Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'"
Monica Geller,Sad,3,11,1,15,"I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,11,1,16,"Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down."
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,11,1,17,"All right, be my guest."
Rachel Green,Sad,3,11,1,18,Good luck.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,11,1,20,"All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it."
#ALL#,Neutral,3,11,1,21,"Oh, I got it."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,11,1,23,"Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... ."
Guy,Joyful,3,11,1,24,"Whoa, you are very beautiful."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,11,1,25,"Oh, thank you."
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,11,2,2,"Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?"
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,11,2,3,"Honey, what's the matter?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,11,2,4,I just saw Janice.
#ALL#,Neutral,3,11,2,5,Oh.
Chandler Bing,Sad,3,11,2,6,"Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,11,2,7,"Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,11,2,8,"Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,11,2,9,"Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know...."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,11,2,10,"Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,11,2,11,"Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,11,2,12,It's Joey's birthday.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,11,2,13,"Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,11,2,15,Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,11,2,17,"Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh."
Mr. Kaplan,Joyful,3,11,3,2,"How's that coffee comin,' dear?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,11,3,3,"Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan."
Mr. Kaplan,Mad,3,11,3,4,"I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,11,3,5,I know!
Mr. Kaplan,Powerful,3,11,3,6,"I'll bet your thinking, 'What's an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?' Eh?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,11,3,7,Op.
Mr. Kaplan,Neutral,3,11,3,8,Eh.
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,11,3,9,"Oh, you got me."
Mr. Kaplan,Powerful,3,11,3,10,"Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,11,3,11,"Oh, that sounds great."
Mr. Kaplan,Joyful,3,11,3,12,"Come on over here, sweetheart."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,11,3,13,"Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much."
Mr. Kaplan,Joyful,3,11,3,14,I need these hangers separated ASAP. You're welcome.
Rachel Green,Mad,3,11,4,2,"Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,11,4,3,"I know honey, I'm sorry."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,11,4,4,"Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,11,4,5,"Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!"
Rachel Green,Scared,3,11,4,6,"Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,11,4,8,Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Guy,Joyful,3,11,4,9,"I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah...."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,11,4,10,"It's not funny, this is actually my job."
Guy,Joyful,3,11,4,11,"Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,11,4,12,"Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger."
Guy,Joyful,3,11,4,13,"Ah, just one other thing."
Rachel Green,Scared,3,11,4,14,Yes?!
Guy,Peaceful,3,11,4,15,"I ah, I work at Bloomingdale's and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,11,4,16,Do you want my pickle?
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,11,6,2,"So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?"
Rachel Green,Powerful,3,11,6,3,"Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,11,6,5,How ya feelin'?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,11,6,6,"Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,11,6,7,Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,11,6,8,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,11,6,9,"Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone."
#ALL#,Joyful,3,11,6,10,Woooo hoooo!!!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,11,6,11,"Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,11,6,12,"Why, what happened?"
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,11,6,13,"Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,11,6,14,What is the worse part?
Chandler Bing,Sad,3,11,6,15,I can't remember which sister.
Ross Geller,Mad,3,11,6,16,You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men!!
Rachel Green,Scared,3,11,8,2,Did he call? Did Mark call?
Monica Geller,Sad,3,11,8,3,"No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet."
Rachel Green,Scared,3,11,8,4,"Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?"
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,11,8,5,I guess they're back from their date.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,11,8,7,Music. Very nice.
Monica Geller,Scared,3,11,8,9,Oh my God!
Rachel Green,Powerful,3,11,8,10,"So, how are you?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,11,8,11,I am good. I finished my book.
Rachel Green,Powerful,3,11,8,13,"Oh yeah, what's it about?"
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,11,8,14,I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,11,8,15,"Yeah, I do."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,11,9,2,Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,11,9,3,"Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,11,9,4,"All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy."
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,11,9,5,What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,11,9,6,Where in Cuba?
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,11,10,2,"Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,11,10,3,Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,11,10,4,I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,11,10,5,"You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,11,10,6,Where's Mary-Angela?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,11,10,7,She's right in there.
Joey's Sisters,Joyful,3,11,10,9,"Hey, Chandler!"
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,11,13,2,Hey!

Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,11,13,7,Hi.
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,11,13,8,Hi.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,11,13,9,How'd did it go?
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,11,13,10,"Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,11,13,11,I'm so proud of you.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,11,13,12,Me too!
Ross Geller,Scared,3,11,13,13,"Listen, I'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so..."

Rachel Green,Neutral,3,11,13,16,Yeah.
Mark Robinson,Joyful,3,11,13,17,Rachel?

Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,11,14,2,"So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,11,14,3,Oh well y'know.

Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,11,14,5,"Ick, you were eavesdropping."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,11,14,6,"Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,11,14,7,"Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,11,14,9,Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,11,14,11,Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,11,14,12,"All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy?"
Ross Geller,Powerful,3,11,14,13,"Ah, we'll all go. Come on."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,11,14,14,Thanks you guys! Thank you.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,11,14,15,Don't worry.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,11,14,16,"God, I hope they kick his ass!"
Rachel Green,Sad,3,11,14,17,"Honey, I'm sorry."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,11,14,18,"Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you."
Guy,Scared,3,11,14,20,May I help you?
Ross Geller,Scared,3,12,2,2,"She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,12,2,3,Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,12,2,4,Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,12,2,5,"I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,12,2,6,"It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco."
Ross Geller,Powerful,3,12,2,7,"Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,12,2,8,What?
Ross Geller,Scared,3,12,2,9,Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,12,2,10,Who?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,12,2,11,I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,12,2,12,The what?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,12,2,13,The abridgment.
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,12,2,14,"Oh, okay. The what?"
Jeannine,Neutral,3,12,4,2,"All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,12,4,3,"Please, I'm not going for anything."
Jeannine,Powerful,3,12,4,4,"Well, if you don't, I will."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,12,4,5,Would you please go?

Monica Geller,Neutral,3,12,4,13,"Have I read it? No, are you enjoying it?"
Julio (poet),Sad,3,12,4,14,"I thought I would, but the translation's no good."
Monica Geller,Sad,3,12,4,15,Your a poet and don't know it.
Julio (poet),Neutral,3,12,4,16,"Actually I ah, I am a poet."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,12,4,17,"Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?"
Julio (poet),Powerful,3,12,4,18,"Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,12,4,19,Mine? Right here?
Julio (poet),Powerful,3,12,4,20,I can write an epic poem about this lip.
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,12,4,21,"How would that go? Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,12,5,2,"You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two.........."

Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,12,5,8,"Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part."
Director,Neutral,3,12,5,9,"Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake."
Mark Robinson,Joyful,3,12,7,2,"Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,12,7,3,"Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm..."
Mark Robinson,Scared,3,12,7,4,Wh-what's that?
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,12,7,5,"It's from Ross, it's a love bug."
Mark Robinson,Neutral,3,12,7,6,Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.
Rachel Green,Mad,3,12,7,7,"Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic."
Man,Joyful,3,12,7,8,"Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green?"

Rachel Green,Neutral,3,12,8,9,"Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do."
Ross Geller,Mad,3,12,8,10,"Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,12,9,2,Mark's a genius!
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,12,9,3,Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,12,9,4,"Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,12,9,5,What am I going to do?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,12,9,6,"Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,12,9,7,I don't know you guys.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,12,9,8,"All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,12,9,9,"And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,12,9,10,He paints quite a picture doesn't he?

Director,Scared,3,12,11,2,"Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,12,11,3,"So, does that mean the audition is off?"
Director,Powerful,3,12,11,4,"Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination."

Monica Geller,Neutral,3,12,12,5,"Oh-ho, look what I got Julio."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,12,12,6,"Yeah, it's a vase."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,12,12,7,"Yeah, just like the one in the poem."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,12,12,8,Well not exactly like the one in the poem.
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,12,12,9,What do you mean?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,12,12,10,Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
Monica Geller,Mad,3,12,13,2,"So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?"
Julio (poet),Powerful,3,12,13,3,What?
Monica Geller,Mad,3,12,13,4,"Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me."
Julio (poet),Scared,3,12,13,5,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,12,13,6,You don't even know me...
Julio (poet),Neutral,3,12,13,7,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,12,13,8,What?
Julio (poet),Peaceful,3,12,13,9,"The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this."
Monica Geller,Sad,3,12,13,10,"I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe..."
Julio (poet),Joyful,3,12,13,11,"No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?"
Monica Geller,Mad,3,12,13,12,Oh yeah.
Director,Joyful,3,12,14,2,"All right, let's do it!"
Director,Neutral,3,12,14,4,"No, no, no. What was that?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,12,14,5,"I know, it was the best I could get out of them."
Director,Neutral,3,12,14,6,"Well, people!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,12,14,7,"People, people, people."
Director,Neutral,3,12,14,8,"Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. Show 'em how it's done. Count it off."
Man,Neutral,3,12,16,2,Is there a Julio here?
Julio (poet),Neutral,3,12,16,3,I am Julio.
Man,Joyful,3,12,16,5,"Mister Pretensous, you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner."
Quartet,Powerful,3,12,16,6,"Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just a buttmunch."
Bass Singer,Powerful,3,12,16,7,No one likes a buttmunch.
Quartet,Powerful,3,12,16,8,And your also bad in bedd-edd-edd!.
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,13,1,2,Hi.
Clerk,Neutral,3,13,1,4,"Six dollars, please."

Clerk,Powerful,3,13,1,6,"Eight o'clock is the cut-off and, aww, it's 8:02."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,13,1,7,"Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you're gonna have to help me out here, 'cause I only have three."
Richard Burke,Powerful,3,13,1,8,I can help with that.
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,13,1,9,Oh my God. Richard? Hi!
Richard Burke,Joyful,3,13,1,10,Hi!
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,13,1,11,"Wow! Your lip went bald. Hey, thanks."
Richard Burke,Joyful,3,13,1,12,"So, you look great."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,13,1,13,Right.
Richard Burke,Scared,3,13,1,14,No you do. You... just...
Monica Geller,Scared,3,13,1,15,What?
Richard Burke,Scared,3,13,1,16,You've got panties stuck to your leg.
Monica Geller,Scared,3,13,1,17,"That's because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it's static cling. Or maybe it's just that God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity."
Richard Burke,Peaceful,3,13,1,18,It's good to see you.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,13,1,19,It's good to see you too.
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,13,2,2,"You see that guy? He's in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he's going straight to the porn."
Richard Burke,Joyful,3,13,2,3,"He's gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy. This is nice."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,13,2,4,Yeah.
Richard Burke,Sad,3,13,2,5,I missed this.
Monica Geller,Sad,3,13,2,6,Me too.
Richard Burke,Joyful,3,13,2,7,"So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?"
Monica Geller,Sad,3,13,2,8,"Oh, um, I don't know if that's a good idea."
Richard Burke,Neutral,3,13,2,9,"Oh. Look, just friends, I won't grope you. I promise."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,13,2,10,"No, I just I think that it's too soon."
Richard Burke,Joyful,3,13,2,11,"No it's not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,13,4,2,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,13,4,3,Hey.
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,13,4,4,Do you have any ice?
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,13,4,5,"Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,13,4,6,"Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,13,4,7,I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Rachel Green,Powerful,3,13,4,8,"Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,13,4,9,"Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,13,4,10,"But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,13,4,11,"Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,13,4,12,How often do you read it?
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,13,4,13,Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,13,4,14,"Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,13,4,15,"The question should be Rach, what is not so great about the shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,13,4,16,"Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,13,4,17,"All right, you got it."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,13,4,18,All right.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,13,4,19,Okay.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,13,4,20,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,13,4,21,"Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,13,4,22,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,13,4,23,"How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?"
Richard Burke,Powerful,3,13,6,2,"So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,13,6,3,"You say 'Thank you very much,' and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we're gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes."
Richard Burke,Scared,3,13,6,5,"Ew, this feels very weird."
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,13,6,6,You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
Richard Burke,Scared,3,13,6,7,"Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them. That's my hand."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,13,6,8,Oops.
Richard Burke,Neutral,3,13,6,9,Okay.
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,13,6,10,Gotta keep squishing.
Richard Burke,Peaceful,3,13,6,11,Tomatoes are squishing.
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,13,6,12,Okay.
Richard Burke,Neutral,3,13,6,14,Op.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,13,6,15,"Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt."

Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,13,6,17,"Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it and it should umm, be....."
Richard Burke,Neutral,3,13,6,19,What?
Monica Geller,Sad,3,13,6,20,"Umm, you've got some on your pants."
Richard Burke,Peaceful,3,13,6,21,I'll just throw them out.
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,13,9,2,So we can be friends who sleep together.
Richard Burke,Joyful,3,13,9,3,"Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,13,9,4,"Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?"
Richard Burke,Neutral,3,13,9,5,Just your dad. Although that's actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister's neighbour next Tuesday.
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,13,9,6,Oh.
Richard Burke,Neutral,3,13,9,7,You want me to cancel it?
Monica Geller,Scared,3,13,9,8,No! No!
Richard Burke,Neutral,3,13,9,9,Okay.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,13,9,10,"'Cause if you do that means you'd be cancelling it for me, and we're just friends."
Richard Burke,Neutral,3,13,9,11,Exactly.
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,13,11,2,Hi.
Rachel Green,Scared,3,13,11,3,Sorry. I'm sorry.
Monica Geller,Mad,3,13,11,4,"You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, in a grill fire."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,13,11,6,What are you smiling at?
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,13,11,7,"I'm sorry, I was just thinking you're day could still pick up."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,13,11,8,"Yeah, right."
Richard Burke,Neutral,3,13,11,10,Hello.

Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,13,12,2,"Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,13,12,3,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,13,12,4,"Please, right now, no, every time I see him it's like 'Is it on the lose?' 'Is it watching me?'"
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,13,12,5,"We can't tell him, you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,13,12,6,"He's right, even if it's to say something complementary."
Robert Bobby,Joyful,3,13,12,7,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,13,12,8,Hey.
Robert Bobby,Powerful,3,13,12,9,"So are ready for the gym? They've got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other."

Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,13,12,15,"Umm, I think you're really, really great..."
Robert Bobby,Mad,3,13,12,16,Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? Is it something I'm putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,13,12,17,"I-I-I-I-I don't know, I don't know what to say."
Gunther,Mad,3,13,12,18,"Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house."
Rachel Green,Scared,3,13,14,2,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,13,14,3,"Beth is really, really sick."

Rachel Green,Neutral,3,13,14,7,Joey?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,13,14,8,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,13,14,9,Do you want to put the book in the freezer?

Rachel Green,Neutral,3,13,14,11,Okay.
Singer,Joyful,3,14,1,2,"'Cause every time I see your face, I can't help but fall from grace. I know....."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,14,1,3,Wow! This girl is good.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,14,1,4,"Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,14,1,5,I like her.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,14,1,6,Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,14,1,7,"Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,14,1,8,Look at you. All jealous.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,14,1,9,"Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she's more.. y'know, and you're more"
Singer,Joyful,3,14,1,10,beside meeeee-eeee-ee. .
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,14,1,11,"Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she's done."
Singer,Powerful,3,14,1,12,"Okay, my next song's called Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldn't Have Left You That Way."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,14,1,14,"Oh no, one of those 'look for the hidden meaning' songs."
Singer,Joyful,3,14,2,2,Hey Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,14,2,3,"Hey Leslie, how'd you know I'd be here?"
Leslie,Neutral,3,14,2,4,"I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm...."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,14,2,5,"All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,14,2,6,"So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,14,2,7,Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,14,2,8,"Ah, anything we might of heard of?"
Leslie,Joyful,3,14,2,9,"Ah, yeah, umm. Home is never far away.."
Leslie,Neutral,3,14,2,11,"Yeah, but, I don't do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,14,2,12,"Hmm, bummer."
Leslie,Peaceful,3,14,2,13,"Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe you'd want to get back together?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,14,2,14,No. But thanks.
Leslie,Peaceful,3,14,2,15,Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,14,2,16,Okay. No. But thanks.
Leslie,Neutral,3,14,2,17,"Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,14,2,18,"Wow, that was kinda brutal."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,14,2,19,"Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y'know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior. Can I have a tissue, please?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,14,2,20,"Yeah, sure."
Gunther,Neutral,3,14,3,2,Someone in there?
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,14,3,3,No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called 'wait until the last moment before I burst and die.'
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,14,3,5,"Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?"
Woman,Peaceful,3,14,3,6,"Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn't wait. I left the lid up for ya though."

Woman,Peaceful,3,14,3,9,Ginger.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,14,3,10,"Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so...."
Ginger,Neutral,3,14,3,11,Don't you have to use the bathroom?
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,14,3,12,"Nope, nope, I'd just ah, I'd rather talk to you. Yes, I do. Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom."
Gunther,Powerful,3,14,3,13,Someone in here.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,14,4,2,Where's Chandler?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,14,4,3,"Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his... Whoa-oh!"
Ginger,Scared,3,14,4,4,Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
Ginger,Scared,3,14,4,6,Joey I can see you okay? You're hiding behind the coats.

Ross Geller,Scared,3,14,5,8,What?
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,14,5,9,"I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,14,5,10,"Come on sweetie! You've had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?"

Chandler Bing,Sad,3,14,7,8,"No, really you're gonna freeze."
Ginger,Neutral,3,14,7,9,"No, I'm not."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,14,7,10,"You're not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?"
Ginger,Neutral,3,14,7,11,"Some day, maybe."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,14,8,2,Funny book?
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,14,8,3,"Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying 'I'll see you Saturday.'"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,14,8,4,"Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn't mind."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,14,8,5,"Oh, no, no, no, it's-it's not the lecture ah, I mind, umm...."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,14,8,6,"Oh, please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,14,8,7,"Oh, well..."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,14,8,8,Oh my God!!! Ross!!
Ross Geller,Mad,3,14,8,9,"Well, I'm sorry, but ah, look if you're not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?"
Rachel Green,Mad,3,14,8,10,"Because, he's my friend."
Ross Geller,Mad,3,14,8,11,"Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean..."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,14,8,12,"Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?"
Ross Geller,Mad,3,14,8,13,Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
Rachel Green,Mad,3,14,8,14,"I don't know, you thought 'See you Saturday' was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,14,8,15,Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,14,8,16,Really!?
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,14,8,17,"Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,14,8,18,"Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. What?"
Ross Geller,Scared,3,14,8,19,"What should I wear, now I'm all nervous."
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,14,9,2,Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,14,9,3,"It's just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn't called. Not that I even care, y'know."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,14,9,4,Phoebe why don't you just call her? You obviously want to.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,14,9,5,You think you know me so well.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,14,9,6,"Well, don't 'cha wanna?"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,14,9,7,Yeah.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,14,9,8,"Okay, well I do know you."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,14,9,9,That's what I said.
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,14,9,10,Well so?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,14,9,11,"I can't. I can't. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was 'Okay, bye Pheebs' gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I've ever had in like all my lives."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,14,12,2,"Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault."
Leslie,Joyful,3,14,12,3,"Wow, that's great."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,14,12,4,"Oh, yeah!"
Leslie,Peaceful,3,14,12,5,"Y'know you could totally sell this. It'd be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,14,12,6,"I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no."
Leslie,Neutral,3,14,12,7,What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,14,12,8,"Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie."
Leslie,Sad,3,14,12,9,"Aw, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,14,12,10,"That's okay. All right, I'm gonna play song that's really, really sad. It's called Magician Box Mix Up."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,14,14,2,Hi!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,14,14,3,Hey.
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,14,14,4,"Oh, can I borrow this? My milk's gone bad."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,14,14,5,"Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,14,14,6,"So umm, how was your date with Ginger?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,14,14,7,"Great. It was great. She's ah, she's great, great looking, great personality, she's greatness."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,14,14,8,"Sounds like she's got the ah, whole package."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,14,14,9,"Joey told you about the leg, huh?"
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,14,14,10,Uh-huh.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,14,14,11,"Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,14,14,12,Morning.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,14,14,13,Actually he's the smallest person in the world.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,14,14,14,Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,14,14,15,It came up.
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,14,14,16,"Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?"
Ross Geller,Sad,3,14,15,2,So I nodded off a little.
Rachel Green,Mad,3,14,15,3,Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Ross Geller,Mad,3,14,15,4,Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.
Rachel Green,Mad,3,14,15,5,"Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he's 'Hey everybody! Remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years. Well there's this little bone we didn't know it had!'"
Ross Geller,Mad,3,14,15,6,"First of all it's Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn't fly."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,14,15,7,"Okay, see now, what I just heard, blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah."
Ross Geller,Mad,3,14,15,8,"Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,14,15,9,"Oh, that is so..."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,14,15,10,"No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island."
Rachel Green,Scared,3,14,15,11,"Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?"
Ross Geller,Sad,3,14,15,12,"No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don't know, I feel like lately, I feel like you're slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you've got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it's dumb, but I hate that I'm not a part of it."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,14,15,13,"It's not dumb. But, maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it. Y'know what I mean? I mean it's like, I-I-I like that you're not involved in that part of my life."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,14,15,14,That's a little clearer.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,14,15,15,"Honey see, it doesn't mean that I don't love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it's-it's for me y'know, I'm out there, on my own, and I'm doing it and it's scary but I love it, because it's mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?"
Ross Geller,Scared,3,14,15,16,"Sure, I-I-I..."
Ginger,Neutral,3,14,16,2,Your thinking about my leg aren't you?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,14,16,3,"No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?"
Ginger,Sad,3,14,16,4,It's okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is 'how much it bothers you?' because I don't like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,14,16,5,No. No. I don't think so.
Ginger,Neutral,3,14,16,6,"Okay. It's just like anything else, you just have to get used to it."
Ginger,Neutral,3,14,16,8,What's that?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,14,16,9,That's-that's my nubbin.
Ginger,Neutral,3,14,16,10,What's a nubbin?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,14,16,11,"It's kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing."
Ginger,Neutral,3,14,16,12,You have three nipples?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,14,16,13,"Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as... Ahh, what?"
Ginger,Scared,3,14,16,14,"Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave."
Chandler Bing,Sad,3,14,16,15,"You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?"
Ginger,Scared,3,14,16,16,"Ah well, it's nubbin. Nothing! Umm. Y'know what, I'll see you later. Okay."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,14,17,2,"Oh, I thought you weren't coming. What? Where were you?"
Leslie,Scared,3,14,17,3,"Come here, come here. Okay, don't get mad, okay."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,14,17,4,"Okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay"
Leslie,Joyful,3,14,17,5,"I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,14,17,6,"No, look, I told you that I didn't want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would've done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can't trust you then just forget it."
Leslie,Sad,3,14,17,7,"No, no, I don't want to forget it."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,14,17,8,"Okay y'know what you have to choose. All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won't be partners. So what's it gonna be?"
Commercial,Neutral,3,14,18,2,"Problem odour in the litter box? Don't change your kitty, change your kitty litter."
Monica Geller,Sad,3,14,18,4,"Sorry, Pheebs."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,14,18,5,Yeah. You okay?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,14,18,6,"Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,14,18,7,Yeah.
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,14,18,8,We'd love too.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,14,18,9,Okay. 'Jingle bitch screwed me over! Go to hell jingle whore! Go to hell Go to hell. Go to hell-hell-hell.' That's all I have so far.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,14,19,2,Well hello!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,14,19,3,Where have you been?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,14,19,4,The doctor.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,14,19,5,Is everything okay?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,14,19,6,"Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,14,19,7,Wow! It's like Rachel in High School.
Rachel Green,Mad,3,14,19,8,What?!!
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,14,19,9,"Come on! Come on, I was kidding! It was such an obvious joke!"
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,14,19,10,"That was an obvious joke, and I didn't think of it. Why didn't I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,15,2,2,Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
Issac,Powerful,3,15,2,3,Can I help you?
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,15,2,4,Uh-oh.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,15,2,5,"Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it."
Issac,Powerful,3,15,2,6,"Chloe, switch with me, there's some guys here that got a crush on you."
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,15,2,7,"Okay, that hurt us."
Chloe,Neutral,3,15,2,8,Hi guys. I haven't seen you since this morning.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,15,2,9,"Well ah, ........y'know."
Chloe,Joyful,3,15,2,10,"Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,15,2,11,Both of us?
Chloe,Joyful,3,15,2,12,Maybe. Does that scare ya?
Chloe,Joyful,3,15,2,14,Relax. It's just Issac's D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should come.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,15,2,15,We'll be there.
Chloe,Joyful,3,15,2,16,"Great. I'll ah, see ya then."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,15,2,17,"All right, rock on."
Mischa,Neutral,3,15,3,3,"He's says, 'Walking with you makes this strange city, feel like home.'"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,15,3,4,"Me too. Although this city is my home, so. So that's dumb what I said, don't tell him I said that. Umm, you make something up. Nice, thank you. This is me. Here."
Mischa,Neutral,3,15,3,6,Your eyes are very pretty.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,15,3,7,"Thank you, very much! Oh! Thank you!"
Mischa,Joyful,3,15,3,9,He would like to kiss you.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,15,3,10,"Okay, y'know what, you don't have to do that now. No-no-no-no!! Not him, you don't! Well the moment's over."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,15,3,12,Oh.
Mischa,Neutral,3,15,3,13,Oy!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,15,4,2,See there it is right there.
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,15,4,3,Wow! It's small.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,15,4,4,Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,15,4,5,"So you had fun, huh?"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,15,4,6,"Yeah. Except for, y'know when you're on a date and you're getting along really great but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,15,4,7,No.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,15,4,8,Hey.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,15,4,10,"What is ah, Rach in her room?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,15,4,11,"Oh no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her."
Ross Geller,Mad,3,15,4,12,Oh what?! Is she gonna cancel on me again?! How can she do this? Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,15,4,13,"All right ah, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject. Call Rachel."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,15,4,14,What's that on the bottom?
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,15,4,15,"Oh that's my doodle of a ladybug, with a top hat. She's fancy."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,15,4,17,Hello.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,15,4,18,"Hey, honey."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,15,4,19,"Oh, hi."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,15,4,20,"Hey, what's going on?"
Rachel Green,Sad,3,15,4,21,"Well, there was a disaster in shipping and I've got to get this order in. Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night."
Ross Geller,Sad,3,15,4,22,"What, do you, well umm, oh how about I come up there?"
Rachel Green,Powerful,3,15,4,23,"No-no-no, no, honey please, I've got, I've just have so much to deal with."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,15,4,25,"Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,15,4,26,"Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?"
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,15,4,27,"Hey, don't call him that! His name is Spackel Back Harry!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,15,5,2,"Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,15,5,3,"Uh, 10:30."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,15,5,4,What time is it now?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,15,5,5,4:30.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,15,5,6,"Yeah all right, so we'll hang out."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,15,5,7,"Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,15,5,8,Yes. Vividly.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,15,5,9,She was kidding about that right?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,15,5,10,"Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so..."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,15,5,11,"God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,15,5,12,"Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,15,5,13,"Dude, I don't know."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,15,5,14,She was kidding.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,15,5,15,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,15,5,16,"She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,15,5,17,"Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,15,5,18,"Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there...."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,15,5,19,"Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,15,5,20,"Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,15,5,21,"Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,15,5,22,"Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,15,7,2,Hey.
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,15,7,3,"Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier..."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,15,7,4,"No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,15,7,5,I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
Ross Geller,Mad,3,15,7,6,For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
Rachel Green,Mad,3,15,7,7,You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
Ross Geller,Mad,3,15,7,8,"Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,15,7,9,"But I told you, I didn't have the time!"
Ross Geller,Mad,3,15,7,10,"Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,15,7,11,"Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?"
Ross Geller,Mad,3,15,7,12,"No, but it'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job!"
Rachel Green,Mad,3,15,7,13,Just a job!
Ross Geller,Mad,3,15,7,14,Yes.
Rachel Green,Mad,3,15,7,15,Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
Ross Geller,Mad,3,15,7,16,"No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,15,7,17,Well neither do I!
Ross Geller,Mad,3,15,7,18,Is this about Mark?
Rachel Green,Mad,3,15,7,19,Oh my God.
Ross Geller,Scared,3,15,7,20,"Okay, it's not, it's not."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,15,7,21,"Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,15,7,22,"Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,15,7,23,"I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,15,7,24,"Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something.."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,15,7,25,No. A break from us.
Chloe,Joyful,3,15,8,2,"And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71."
Chloe,Joyful,3,15,8,4,"Hey, it's the dinosaur guy. Hi, Ross."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,15,8,5,"Oh, hi Chloe."
Chloe,Joyful,3,15,8,6,"I want you to met some friends of mine. This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say 'let's Ross it!'"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,15,8,7,And that's the only colour that comes in.
Issac,Joyful,3,15,8,8,"Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?"
Chloe,Mad,3,15,8,9,Oh!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,15,8,10,"So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner."
Ross Geller,Mad,3,15,8,11,"Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,15,9,2,"Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?"
Mischa,Joyful,3,15,9,3,"Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight."
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,15,9,4,Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,15,9,5,"Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,15,9,7,You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Mischa,Neutral,3,15,9,8,Boutros Boutros Gali.
Mischa,Neutral,3,15,9,10,He says he was too.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,15,9,11,Interesting.
Mischa,Neutral,3,15,9,12,So I was wondering....
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,15,9,13,"Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit."
Mischa,Joyful,3,15,9,15,"Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. So you're a chef?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,15,9,16,I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
Mischa,Neutral,3,15,9,17,"Oh, really."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,15,9,18,"Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?"
Monica Geller,Scared,3,15,9,19,"Well, I was having a conversation."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,15,9,20,"Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other."
Monica Geller,Sad,3,15,9,21,What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,15,9,22,That would be great. Thank you.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,15,10,2,Hello!
Mark Robinson,Joyful,3,15,10,3,"Oh, hi. It's Mark."
Rachel Green,Sad,3,15,10,4,Oh.
Mark Robinson,Scared,3,15,10,5,What? Is it my breath?
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,15,10,6,"No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!"
Mark Robinson,Neutral,3,15,10,7,"Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn't tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,15,10,8,"Yeah. Well, umm....."
Mark Robinson,Neutral,3,15,10,9,"Rach, are you okay?"
Rachel Green,Sad,3,15,10,10,"Yeah, I'm fine."
Mark Robinson,Neutral,3,15,10,11,"You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?"
Rachel Green,Sad,3,15,10,12,"No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay."
Mark Robinson,Peaceful,3,15,10,13,"All right, all right, I'm coming over, and I'm bringing Chinese food."
Rachel Green,Sad,3,15,10,14,"Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry."
Mark Robinson,Peaceful,3,15,10,15,It's for me.
Rachel Green,Sad,3,15,10,16,"Oh. Okay, bye."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,15,11,2,So what are you gonna do?
Ross Geller,Sad,3,15,11,3,"What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up."
Chandler Bing,Sad,3,15,11,4,"Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out."
Ross Geller,Mad,3,15,11,5,"Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?"
Chandler Bing,Sad,3,15,11,6,"Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,15,11,8,Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,15,11,9,"Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,15,11,10,Why? What happened to him?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,15,11,11,"Nothing, he's just really believes in that."
Rachel Green,Sad,3,15,12,2,"Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break."
Mark Robinson,Neutral,3,15,12,3,Wow. I'm sorry. Eggroll?
Rachel Green,Sad,3,15,12,4,"No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there."
Mark Robinson,Neutral,3,15,12,5,"Well, then he's, he's probably just, out."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,15,12,6,"Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,15,12,8,Hello.
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,15,12,9,Hi! It's me.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,15,12,10,"Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,15,12,11,"Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?"
Mark Robinson,Neutral,3,15,12,12,"Hey, what do you want to drink?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,15,12,13,Who's that?
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,15,12,14,Nobody.
Mark Robinson,Neutral,3,15,12,15,Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,15,12,17,Is that Mark?
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,15,12,18,"Umm, honey, look he just came over to...."
Ross Geller,Mad,3,15,12,20,Yeah! Got it!
Chloe,Peaceful,3,15,12,21,"Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance."
Ross Geller,Sad,3,15,12,22,"Ah, that's okay, thanks."
Chloe,Peaceful,3,15,12,23,"Hey, you don't have to smile. You just have to dance."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,15,12,24,"Look, I don't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?"
Chloe,Peaceful,3,15,12,25,"Oh, okay. Hey, two beers."
Mischa,Sad,3,15,13,2,"And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages."
Monica Geller,Sad,3,15,13,3,Oh. Can I have a tissue?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,15,13,4,"Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it."
Mischa,Sad,3,15,13,6,"Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,15,13,7,"Well, tell him, apology accepted."
Mischa,Mad,3,15,13,9,"Oh, he's unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no!! You silly diplomat, why don't you learn some English, Sergei?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,15,13,10,"Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?"
Monica Geller,Sad,3,15,13,11,"Hey, the man's dog just died."
Mischa,Powerful,3,15,13,13,I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,15,13,14,It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.
Sergei,Scared,3,15,13,15,"Uh, plate?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,15,13,16,"Plate! Yes, plate."
Sergei,Joyful,3,15,13,17,Plate. Plate. Plate.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,15,13,18,"See, we don't need them."
Sergei,Peaceful,3,15,13,19,Plate?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,15,13,20,Yeah.
Sergei,Joyful,3,15,17,3,"Touchet, touchet, Miss Americccan pie. Ameri-ccan."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,15,17,4,Ameri-can.
Sergei,Peaceful,3,15,17,5,Ameri-ccan.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,15,17,6,Ameri-can. Y'know it's a very hard language. Let's do it again.
Sergei,Joyful,3,15,17,8,Everybody!!
Ross Geller,Sad,3,16,1,2,"I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,16,1,3,You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you've got a girlfriend?
Ross Geller,Mad,3,16,1,4,Is this about Mark?
Rachel Green,Mad,3,16,1,5,Oh my God.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,16,1,6,"Okay, it's not, it's not."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,16,1,7,"Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,16,1,8,"Fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something.."
Rachel Green,Sad,3,16,1,9,No. A break from us.
Rachel Green,Sad,3,16,2,2,"Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,16,2,3,"I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?"
Mark Robinson,Neutral,3,16,2,4,"Hey, what do you want to drink?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,16,2,5,Who's that?
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,16,2,6,Nobody.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,16,2,7,Is that Mark?
Rachel Green,Scared,3,16,2,8,"Umm, honey, look he just came over to...."
Ross Geller,Mad,3,16,2,9,Yeah! Got it!
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,16,4,2,Hey.
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,16,4,3,Hey.
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,16,4,4,How's the big anniversary dinner?
Rachel Green,Sad,3,16,4,5,"Well, we never actually got to dinner."
Monica Geller,Sad,3,16,4,6,"Ohhh, nice."
Rachel Green,Sad,3,16,4,7,"No, we kinda broke up instead."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,16,4,8,What?!
Rachel Green,Scared,3,16,4,9,"God, Monica it's on the ceiling."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,16,4,10,"That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!"
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,16,4,11,"Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,16,4,12,Oh no!!
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,16,4,13,No.
Monica Geller,Scared,3,16,4,14,"Rachel, you and Mark?!"
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,16,4,15,"No, no-no, it's okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,16,7,2,Hey!
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,16,7,3,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,16,7,4,"Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,16,7,5,"Oh, there's banana on it."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,16,7,6,"Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,16,7,7,So then you know?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,16,7,8,"The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,16,7,9,"Oh, good. Thanks."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,16,7,10,Now what is Fabutec?
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,16,7,11,"Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing...."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,16,7,12,Waxine!!
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,16,7,13,Yes! Have you seen it?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,16,7,14,"Oh, it's incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,16,7,15,I know!!
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,16,7,16,God. Do think it really doesn't hurt? 'Cause how can they do that?
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,16,7,17,Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,16,7,18,They have the best stuff in there.
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,16,8,2,Oh my God! Oh my God!
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,16,8,3,"Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?"
Ross Geller,Sad,3,16,8,4,"You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,16,8,5,"Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,16,8,6,"What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?"
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,16,8,7,"Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,16,8,8,"He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,16,8,9,"Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,16,8,10,"Yeah, but don't you think...."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,16,8,11,"All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,16,8,12,"Yeah, okay."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,16,8,13,"All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,16,8,14,What trail?
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,16,8,15,The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,16,8,16,"Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,16,8,17,"Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,16,9,2,"After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,"
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,16,9,3,Did that!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,16,9,4,Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
Monica Geller,Sad,3,16,9,5,Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,16,9,6,Was it not pain-free?
Monica Geller,Mad,3,16,9,7,"No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,16,9,8,"Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,16,9,9,"That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,16,9,10,Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,16,9,11,"Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?"
Ross Geller,Mad,3,16,11,2,Jasmine?
Jasmine,Joyful,3,16,11,3,Uh-huh.
Ross Geller,Mad,3,16,11,4,"We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller."
Jasmine,Mad,3,16,11,5,You did a bad thing!
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,16,11,6,"Yes, I did."
Jasmine,Sad,3,16,11,7,Very bad!
Ross Geller,Sad,3,16,11,8,Very bad.
Jasmine,Mad,3,16,11,9,"Very, very bad."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,16,11,10,"I'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?"
Jasmine,Neutral,3,16,11,11,No.
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,16,11,12,"Okay, Jasmine, please, please don't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?"
Jasmine,Peaceful,3,16,11,13,All right.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,16,11,14,"Thank you, thank you."
Jasmine,Scared,3,16,11,15,"But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too."
Ross Geller,Mad,3,16,11,16,Who's your roommate?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,16,14,2,They've been quiet for a long time.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,16,14,3,Maybe she killed him?
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,16,14,4,Let's go.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,16,14,6,Is that your new walk?
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,16,14,7,"No, I really have to pee."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,17,3,2,"Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,17,3,3,Wait. Really?! 'Cause mine get me out of tickets.
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,17,3,4,"Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending this time with me. It's been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say thanks."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,17,3,5,Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,17,3,6,"Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it'll be great!"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,17,3,7,It'll be great for next weekend.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,17,3,8,"No, no, no, this weekend guys!"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,17,3,9,"It'll be great for next weekend. I mean, it'll be grrreat."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,17,3,10,What's going on?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,17,3,11,"Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel's sister's cabin."
Ross Geller,Sad,3,17,3,12,"So, for the whole weekend?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,17,3,13,"We're really sorry, but um, she did ask us first."
Ross Geller,Sad,3,17,3,14,"Yeah, that's okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I'm alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,17,3,15,"Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay. 'Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,17,3,16,"Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay."
Monica Geller,Sad,3,17,3,17,Noo! I'll stay. He's my brother.
Ross Geller,Sad,3,17,3,18,What a pity stay?
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,17,3,19,No! We're gonna have fun. We can make fudge!
Ross Geller,Sad,3,17,3,20,"Pity food? Y'know what that's okay, all right, I don't need any of you to stay, okay nobody stays."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,17,3,21,"Well, then, I might as well offer to stay."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,17,4,2,"Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?"
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,17,4,3,Why? Do you think he's still mad at us?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,17,4,4,Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,17,4,5,What? Mine aren't tinted.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,17,4,7,Chandler!!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,17,4,8,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,17,4,9,What does the sign say?
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,17,4,10,Beam me up Jesus.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,17,4,11,"No, the 'No Smoking' sign. There's no smoking in my Grandmother's cab."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,17,4,12,"Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom."
#ALL#,Peaceful,3,17,4,13,Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,17,4,14,Please!
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,17,4,15,No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,17,4,16,"Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,17,4,17,"Oh, now I have to go!!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,17,5,2,"Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,17,5,3,What?
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,17,5,5,Okay.
Monica Geller,Scared,3,17,5,6,Ow!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,17,5,8,Aren't you gonna go?
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,17,5,9,No. Thank you.
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,17,5,10,"No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,17,5,11,"Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is 'no tissue, no tuschy.' Well, if everybody's going."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,17,5,12,"No, y'know what don't close it 'cause the... keys...are in there."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,17,5,13,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,17,5,14,What's going on?
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,17,5,15,My lighter's in there!
Carol Willick,Joyful,3,17,7,2,Hi!
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,17,7,3,Hey.
Carol Willick,Neutral,3,17,7,4,"Hey, what are you doing here?"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,17,7,5,"Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?"
Carol Willick,Peaceful,3,17,7,6,"Ah yeah, but now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,17,7,7,Where's Ben?
Carol Willick,Neutral,3,17,7,8,He's sleeping.
Ross Geller,Scared,3,17,7,9,"Ahh. Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?"
Carol Willick,Peaceful,3,17,7,10,"Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,17,7,11,"Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?"
Carol Willick,Neutral,3,17,7,12,It's not that kind of anniversary.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,17,7,13,Ah! Oh.
Carol Willick,Neutral,3,17,7,14,Sooo!! Anyway...
Ross Geller,Sad,3,17,7,15,"Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. 'Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up."
Carol Willick,Sad,3,17,7,16,"Oh God, Ross I am so sorry."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,17,7,17,"Yeah, well."
Carol Willick,Peaceful,3,17,7,18,"Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,17,7,19,"Oh yeah, I'd love that."
Carol Willick,Joyful,3,17,7,20,"Oh, great! Me too."
Ross Geller,Sad,3,17,7,21,I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,17,8,2,"Okay, yeah. Triple A can pick us up."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,17,8,3,Great!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,17,8,4,"Yeah, what town are we near?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,17,8,5,"Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?"
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,17,8,6,Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we're on?
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,17,8,7,"Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,17,8,8,"Okay. We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. There is no Route 27. Okay, either 93 or 76?"
Rachel Green,Scared,3,17,8,9,"I don't know, I'm sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,17,8,10,"Okay. Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93? Okay! Yeah, no they don't do that."
Rachel Green,Scared,3,17,8,11,"Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,17,8,12,"Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,17,8,13,"No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,17,8,14,But if...
Rachel Green,Mad,3,17,8,15,"No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you'll have to think of something else."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,17,8,16,"Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,17,8,18,So the going for help went well?
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,17,8,19,"Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,17,8,20,I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
Monica Geller,Mad,3,17,8,21,Then why are you smoking?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,17,8,22,Well it's very unsettling.
Ross Geller,Scared,3,17,9,2,"....right? Right? I mean it's pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don't, I don't need them, huh, I've got you guys now as friends, you and Susan."
Carol Willick,Joyful,3,17,9,3,"Ah, Susan will be so pleased."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,17,9,5,"717? Where's 717? Hey, you've have more of these for Susan right?"
Carol Willick,Neutral,3,17,9,6,"No. But it's okay, I'll just put out pickles or something."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,17,9,8,"Ross, thank God."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,17,9,9,"Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,17,9,10,I ate a bug.
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,17,9,12,"Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a penny. Let's stock up."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,17,9,13,"Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck."
Ross Geller,Mad,3,17,9,14,"Oh, now you want a favour?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,17,9,15,"Yes, please."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,17,9,16,"Well, oh, I'm sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I'm a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?"
Carol Willick,Powerful,3,17,9,17,"Phoebe, hang on a second. Here, take my car, go pick up your friends."
Ross Geller,Powerful,3,17,9,18,"No, I'm not gonna pick them up."
Carol Willick,Powerful,3,17,9,19,"Listen, we both know you're gonna do it 'cause you're not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car."
Ross Geller,Sad,3,17,9,20,"No, Rachel doesn't want me to...."
Carol Willick,Neutral,3,17,9,21,"Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you 'cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don't punish your friends for what Rachel did to you."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,17,9,22,"Yeah, you're right."
Carol Willick,Mad,3,17,9,23,Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. What? You slept with someone else?!
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,17,9,24,"We were on a break!!! Okay!! We were, we were..., yeah. Where are you? I'll find you."
Carol Willick,Mad,3,17,9,25,You slept with another woman?
Ross Geller,Mad,3,17,9,26,"Oh, you-you're-you're one to talk."
Carol Willick,Mad,3,17,11,2,Ugh. Ross!
Ross Geller,Scared,3,17,11,3,Hi! Sorry I'm late. Were you sleeping?
Carol Willick,Peaceful,3,17,11,4,"Ahh, nooo!!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,17,11,5,"Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, 'cause that's not where you want to skimp."
Carol Willick,Joyful,3,17,11,6,"You're a genius, Ross."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,17,11,7,"Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?"
Carol Willick,Mad,3,17,11,8,"Okay, I'll pay you tomorrow."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,17,11,9,Okay.
Carol Willick,Joyful,3,17,11,10,"Okay, bye!!"
Ross Geller,Scared,3,17,11,11,"So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?"
Carol Willick,Mad,3,17,11,12,"Yeah, okay, bye."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,17,11,13,So I'm gonna take off then!
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,18,1,2,What's so funny?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,18,1,3,"Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,18,1,4,Oh.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,18,1,5,What-what's so funny?
Gunther,Peaceful,3,18,1,7,"Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there's none of that in here."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,18,1,8,Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
Gunther,Neutral,3,18,1,9,"Okay, but only if you give me a drag."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,18,1,10,Okay.
Gunther,Peaceful,3,18,1,12,"Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,18,1,13,"No-no, why don't you hang on to that one."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,18,1,15,"Okay, that's like the least fun game ever."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,18,1,16,"Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,18,1,17,"Oh. Nope, that patch is no good."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,18,1,18,"Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,18,1,19,Pffhah.
Rachel Green,Mad,3,18,1,20,What's your problem?
Ross Geller,Mad,3,18,1,21,"Nothing, it's just that hypnosis is beyond crap."
Rachel Green,Powerful,3,18,1,22,"Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City."
Ross Geller,Mad,3,18,1,23,"Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay."
Rachel Green,Powerful,3,18,1,24,"Oh right, 'cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,18,1,25,"All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,18,1,26,Or what my Father called Thursday night.
Monica Geller,Sad,3,18,4,2,"And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,18,4,3,"Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,18,4,4,"Pete, can I get you something else?"
Peter Becker,Neutral,3,18,4,5,"Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given' 'em out."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,18,4,6,Haven't you and I covered that topic?
Peter Becker,Peaceful,3,18,4,7,"Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you...."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,18,4,8,"Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food."
Peter Becker,Joyful,3,18,4,9,"Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,18,4,10,"Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,18,4,11,"I mean really, think about it."
Peter Becker,Joyful,3,18,4,12,"Ho-ho, I will."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,18,5,2,"No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!"
Ross Geller,Scared,3,18,5,3,"Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,18,5,4,"No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,18,5,5,"Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,18,5,6,"But, I mean, do you think he's gonna enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, and it-it's not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it's not good home economics."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,18,5,7,"Well, have-have you told him how you feel?"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,18,5,8,Yes. Not out loud.
Ross Geller,Sad,3,18,5,9,"Pheebs, if you don't tell him, soon he's gonna be married, and then you're gonna hate yourself."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,18,5,10,"Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,18,5,12,"Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!"
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,18,5,14,"Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,18,5,15,"So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, ""Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,"" remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, ""Nah, let's just hang out at your place."" Well, that was a nice move dumb ass."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,18,9,2,"Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I'm so glad you could come, 'cause I've got a real umm, Home Ec emergency."
Alice Knight,Scared,3,18,9,3,"Oh my God, who died on this?!"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,18,9,4,"Yeah, I know. It's a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?"
Alice Knight,Neutral,3,18,9,5,"Absolutely. Okay, first we'll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn't work we can go back to..."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,18,9,6,"Y'know what, forget it. It's ruined."
Alice Knight,Peaceful,3,18,9,7,"Oh no-no, never say that. If we can't get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,18,9,8,"Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank."
Peter Becker,Peaceful,3,18,10,2,"Okay, that's great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin."
#ALL#,Neutral,3,18,10,3,"Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay."
Secretary,Neutral,3,18,10,5,You have a Miss Monica Geller here.
Peter Becker,Powerful,3,18,10,6,"Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. Hi."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,18,10,7,What the hell is this?
Peter Becker,Scared,3,18,10,8,Hang on a second. I'll-I'll talk to you in the morning. I'm sorry what?
Monica Geller,Mad,3,18,10,9,"Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?"
Peter Becker,Neutral,3,18,10,10,"Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,18,10,11,"You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?"
Employee,Neutral,3,18,10,12,"Umm, I'm still here."
Peter Becker,Powerful,3,18,10,13,"You're taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn't leave you that tip, you wouldn't of come down here, we wouldn't be having this argument, and there wouldn't be this ah, heat between us."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,18,10,14,What?!
Peter Becker,Neutral,3,18,10,15,"Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. 'Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we're like this-this couple that fights."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,18,10,16,"Okay, umm, you're a loon."
Peter Becker,Joyful,3,18,10,17,"Look, forget the check, okay. I like you. I think you're great. Come on, what do you say?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,18,10,18,I don't know.
Peter Becker,Neutral,3,18,10,19,Why not?
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,18,10,20,'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
Peter Becker,Powerful,3,18,10,21,"One meal! That's all I'm asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you don't have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even."
Frank Buffay Jr.,Joyful,3,18,11,2,"Hi. Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It's-it's me!"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,18,11,3,"Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,Sad,3,18,11,4,"Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I'd curl up in it. Is that all right?"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,18,11,5,"Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,Sad,3,18,11,6,"Oh, well just probably the worst one since I've been alive."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,18,11,7,"What umm, what happened?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,Sad,3,18,11,8,"Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,18,11,9,"Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,Sad,3,18,11,10,"Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don't see how I could all of the sudden be too young, 'cause I'm older than I was when we first got together."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,18,11,11,"Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't know. But, y'know what, maybe it's just all for the best?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,Sad,3,18,11,12,"Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,18,11,13,"Oh, sweetie, oh."
Frank Buffay Jr.,Sad,3,18,11,14,"Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it's, and now it's gone and I don't know why!"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,18,11,15,"Uh, well I can tell you why. It's, it's because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,Scared,3,18,11,16,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,18,11,17,"Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together, y'know. And you're gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will."
Frank Buffay Jr.,Mad,3,18,11,18,"Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,18,11,19,Okay.
Frank Buffay Jr.,Sad,3,18,11,20,"Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn't want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,18,11,21,"Okay, but."
Frank Buffay Jr.,Mad,3,18,11,22,"Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you'd understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go..."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,18,12,2,Oh my God! The millionaire's here!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,18,12,3,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,Mad,3,18,12,4,"Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?"
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,18,12,5,"Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,18,12,6,I know!!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,18,12,7,"Okay, then get the lobster!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,18,12,8,Hey!
Peter Becker,Peaceful,3,18,12,9,Hi.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,18,12,10,Hi!!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,18,12,11,Hey!
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,18,12,12,Hi!
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,18,12,14,"Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?"
Monica Geller,Mad,3,18,12,15,"And that's why, I'm not inviting you in for a drink. Bye."
#ALL#,Sad,3,18,12,16,Oh-no-no-no-no....
Rachel Green,Sad,3,18,12,17,Just one drink?!
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,18,12,18,"So, where do you want to go?"
Peter Becker,Joyful,3,18,12,19,"Hey, you like pizza?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,18,12,20,"Oh, that's sounds great."
Peter Becker,Joyful,3,18,12,21,I know a great little place.
Peter Becker,Powerful,3,18,13,2,"You're, hey, you're not paying for the pizza!"
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,18,13,3,"Oh come on, it's only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?"
Peter Becker,Powerful,3,18,13,4,"Ahh, I'd throw another thousand on that."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,18,13,5,"Why, how much is that?"
Peter Becker,Joyful,3,18,13,6,That's about 60 cents.
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,18,15,2,"Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn't. There's someone here who can explain this better than I can."
Alice Knight,Neutral,3,18,15,3,Hi Frank.
Frank Buffay Jr.,Neutral,3,18,15,4,"Hi, Mrs. Knight."
Alice Knight,Scared,3,18,15,5,"Phoebe's right Frank. I know it's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. Is that it, is that what it is?"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,18,15,6,"Yeah, but not just that."
Alice Knight,Scared,3,18,15,7,"Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less..."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,18,15,8,None the less.
Alice Knight,Powerful,3,18,15,9,"None the less. Umm, you're too young to, to really know what you want."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,18,15,10,"That's right, exactly. All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. ."
Gunther,Joyful,3,19,1,2,Here you go.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,19,1,3,Thank you.
Gunther,Peaceful,3,19,1,4,"Say Rachel, I was wondering if you'd like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you'd just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover."
Mark Robinson,Peaceful,3,19,1,5,Hi!
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,19,1,6,"Hi! All right, let's go shoppin'!!"
Mark Robinson,Peaceful,3,19,1,7,"Um, y'know, before we go ah, there's something I need to say."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,19,1,8,"Oh, okay."
Mark Robinson,Joyful,3,19,1,9,"I've kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. But since you were with Ross, I-I didn't do anything about it. But, now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that's-that's what I'm doing, now."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,19,1,11,Wow! Umm....
Gunther,Sad,3,19,1,13,I dropped a cup.
Peter Becker,Neutral,3,19,2,2,"...so y'know, that's why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, 'Wash my car.' 'Clean my room.' It's not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it'll understand what you're saying."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,19,2,3,"Oh, this is so great."
Peter Becker,Joyful,3,19,2,4,"Yeah, it was."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,19,2,5,All right then. Bye.
Monica Geller,Mad,3,19,2,7,"Hello, people who do not live here."
#ALL#,Joyful,3,19,2,8,Hi! Hello!
Monica Geller,Mad,3,19,2,9,I gave you a key for emergencies!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,19,2,10,We were out of Doritos.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,19,2,11,"Hey, how'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,19,2,12,"Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,19,2,13,"He's great! I mean we have such a good time together! He's so funny, and sooo sweet, and I'm not attracted to him at all!!"
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,19,2,14,Still?!
Monica Geller,Mad,3,19,2,15,"Noo!! It's driving me crazy. I mean every other way he's like the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,19,2,16,Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,19,2,17,Two.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,19,2,18,Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,19,2,19,"Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,19,2,20,I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,19,2,22,"Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you."
The Director,Neutral,3,19,3,2,Joe. How's it going?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,19,3,3,Good. Hey.
Kate Miller,Neutral,3,19,3,4,Hi.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,19,3,5,"Oh, so you're playing Adrienne, huh?"
Kate Miller,Peaceful,3,19,3,6,Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,19,3,7,"Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I'm Joey Tribianni."
Kate Miller,Neutral,3,19,3,8,"Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,19,3,10,"So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?"
Kate Miller,Neutral,3,19,3,11,"Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray's work. She's so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,19,3,12,"Oh, forget about it. She rocks!"
Kate Miller,Neutral,3,19,3,13,Where do I know you from?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,19,3,14,Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
Kate Miller,Neutral,3,19,3,15,"No, that's not it. So, you're a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,19,3,16,"Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor."
Kate Miller,Joyful,3,19,3,17,That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You're-you're-you're the guy that doesn't know how to pour milk!!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,19,3,18,"See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn't. Now, see, that's acting."
Kate Miller,Joyful,3,19,3,19,"Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,19,3,20,"Yeah, that was real."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,19,4,2,Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,19,4,3,I know.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,19,4,4,"What, so what are you gonna tell him?"
Rachel Green,Scared,3,19,4,5,"Well, I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,19,4,6,Huh.
Rachel Green,Scared,3,19,4,8,"I mean I think I'd say no to anybody right now. Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I'm standing there with this charming, cute guy, who's asking me to go out with him, which I'm allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,19,4,9,"Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,19,4,10,I don't have any issues with my Father.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,19,4,11,"Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing then."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,19,5,2,"I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,19,5,3,Hello.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,19,5,5,So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,19,5,6,"Wow, what-what do you think she wants?"
Ross Geller,Powerful,3,19,5,7,"Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,19,5,8,"It's possible. You are very loveable, I'd miss you if I broke up with you. I was just trying to be supportive."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,19,5,9,Then be supportive like a guy.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,19,5,10,"If I broke up with you, I'd miss you."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,19,7,2,"So, you're like a zillionaire?"
Chandler Bing,Sad,3,19,7,3,And you're our age. You're our age.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,19,7,4,"Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself."
Peter Becker,Joyful,3,19,7,5,What like Pete Dakota?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,19,7,6,"Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,19,7,7,"Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago."
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,19,7,8,That's not a state Joe.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,19,7,9,"Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?"
Peter Becker,Neutral,3,19,7,10,"I got to go, so ah, I'll see you guys later."
#ALL#,Neutral,3,19,7,11,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,19,7,12,You're our age!
Peter Becker,Joyful,3,19,7,13,"So ah, we on for tomorrow?"
Monica Geller,Scared,3,19,7,14,"Absolutely! Now get out of here you!! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young, and then there's Pete who's-who's crazy about me, and who's absolutely perfect for me, and there's like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something's wrong with me?!"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,19,7,15,"Yeah, kinda."
Kate Miller,Joyful,3,19,8,2,Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,19,8,3,"Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and nothin'. You look at me, and it's nothin'. Nothing."
The Director,Powerful,3,19,8,4,"Tasty! I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it's-it's nice."
Kate Miller,Neutral,3,19,8,5,I have a question about this scene.
The Director,Neutral,3,19,8,6,Yes?
Kate Miller,Scared,3,19,8,7,"Well, I don't understand why Adrienne's attracted to Victor."
The Director,Powerful,3,19,8,8,"Peel the onion. First of all, he's good looking."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,19,8,9,Yeah.
Kate Miller,Neutral,3,19,8,10,I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,19,8,11,"Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch."
Kate Miller,Sad,3,19,8,12,It doesn't say that in the script.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,19,8,13,It does in mine!
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,19,10,2,Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can't just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You're gonna get peep eye!
Ross Geller,Mad,3,19,10,3,"I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she'd say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!"
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,19,10,4,You didn't just break up.
Ross Geller,Mad,3,19,10,5,"Hey, it's been like three weeks!"
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,19,10,6,You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
Ross Geller,Scared,3,19,10,7,"Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I'm gonna kill myself, I swear. I can't, I can't watch this. Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she's going in."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,19,10,8,Okay.
Ross Geller,Scared,3,19,10,9,"She's going in. Wait! He's going in! He's going in!! The door's closed! I, I can't see anything but the door closed!!"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,19,10,10,And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
Ross Geller,Scared,3,19,10,11,"Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!"
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,19,10,12,Stop what?!
Ross Geller,Scared,3,19,10,13,"I don't know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I'll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!"
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,19,10,15,No!! You can't!!
Ross Geller,Mad,3,19,10,16,"Look, they must be stopped!"
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,19,10,17,"I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! You are surprisingly strong!"
Ross Geller,Scared,3,19,10,18,I need juice! People need juice!!
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,19,10,19,Look man!
Ross Geller,Mad,3,19,10,20,People need juice!
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,19,10,21,Listen to me!!
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,19,10,22,"Juice, I need..."
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,19,10,23,"She's moving on! Okay, if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else! And unless you're thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It's over."
Ross Geller,Sad,3,19,10,24,"Yeah, okay."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,19,10,25,Okay.
Ross Geller,Sad,3,19,10,26,It's just I miss her so much.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,19,10,27,I know.
Mark Robinson,Scared,3,19,11,2,Why do all you're coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,19,11,3,"Oh. That's so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, 'Where's number 27?!'"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,19,11,5,Y'know what?
Mark Robinson,Scared,3,19,11,6,No. And I don't think I'm gonna want to.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,19,11,7,I can't do this.
Mark Robinson,Neutral,3,19,11,8,"Yep. Yep, that's what I didn't want to know."
Rachel Green,Sad,3,19,11,9,"Well, oh, Mark, I'm doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I'm just doing it to get back at Ross. I'm sorry, it's not very fair to you."
Mark Robinson,Joyful,3,19,11,10,"Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!"
Rachel Green,Sad,3,19,11,11,Oh God. I'm sorry about this.
Mark Robinson,Peaceful,3,19,11,12,That's okay.
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,19,11,13,You sure?
Mark Robinson,Neutral,3,19,11,14,Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
Spokeswoman,Neutral,3,19,12,2,"...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size..."
Peter Becker,Neutral,3,19,12,3,"Hey, can I ask you something?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,19,12,4,Sure.
Peter Becker,Scared,3,19,12,5,Where are we?
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,19,12,6,"Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I'm gonna say, midget rodeo."
Peter Becker,Neutral,3,19,12,7,Just tell me the truth.
Monica Geller,Scared,3,19,12,8,"Okay. Umm, y'know, I don't think, I don't think I told you this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship."
Peter Becker,Peaceful,3,19,12,9,"Oh, yeah. Wasn't that like a year ago?"
Monica Geller,Scared,3,19,12,10,"So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn't the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?"
Peter Becker,Neutral,3,19,12,11,"Oh, yeah. I know that."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,19,12,12,I so wanna be attracted to you.
Peter Becker,Sad,3,19,12,13,"But you're not. Okay, good."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,19,12,14,I'm sorry.
Peter Becker,Sad,3,19,12,15,"Y'know what, don't be. This is not, don't be, 'cause it's not so bad."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,19,12,16,It's not?
Peter Becker,Peaceful,3,19,12,17,"I know I'm no John Bon Jovi, or someone who find attractive, I'm just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling differently."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,19,12,18,"Well, um, look I-I don't want this to come our wrong, but ah, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted too."
Peter Becker,Neutral,3,19,12,19,"Yeah, stupidly charming isn't' it? Well listen let's, you wanna get something to eat? 'Cause this place is kinda depressing."
Spokeswoman,Neutral,3,19,12,20,And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.
Peter Becker,Neutral,3,19,12,21,One second.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,19,13,2,I don't think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in. Draw!!
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,19,13,4,"I wasn't doing anything. Uh-oh, what did she do now?"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,19,13,5,"Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,19,13,6,"Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,19,13,7,"God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,19,13,8,I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,19,13,9,"Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,19,13,10,"I'm talking about you. You big, big freak."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,19,13,11,"Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,19,13,12,"Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,19,13,13,"Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!"
Kate Miller,Mad,3,19,14,2,Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,19,14,3,"Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and it's nothin'. You look at me, and nothin'. Nothing."
The Director,Powerful,3,19,14,4,"You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we're gonna pick it up here, tomorrow."
Kate Miller,Joyful,3,19,14,5,"Well, that was ah..."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,19,14,6,Better?
Kate Miller,Joyful,3,19,14,7,"Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G'night."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,19,14,8,"Ah, Kate?"
Kate Miller,Neutral,3,19,14,9,Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,19,14,10,"You ah, you forgot your shoes."
Kate Miller,Joyful,3,19,14,11,I'm probably gonna need those. Huh?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,19,14,12,"Hey, listen you ah...."
Kate Miller,Neutral,3,19,14,13,Hmm?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,19,14,14,...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
Kate Miller,Neutral,3,19,14,15,Umm.
The Director,Neutral,3,19,14,16,Kate?
Kate Miller,Neutral,3,19,14,17,Yep.
The Director,Neutral,3,19,14,18,You ready to go?
Kate Miller,Neutral,3,19,14,19,Yeah.
The Director,Joyful,3,19,14,20,Very nice. Very nice.
Kate Miller,Peaceful,3,19,14,21,"So umm, I'll see you tomorrow, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,19,14,22,"Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,19,15,2,"Hey! Why isn't it Spiderman? Y'know like Goldman, Silverman..."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,19,15,3,'Cause it's-it's not his last name.
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,19,15,4,It isn't?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,19,15,5,"No, it's not like, like Phil Spiderman. He's a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there's no Gold Man."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,19,15,6,"Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!"
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,19,15,7,Hey!
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,19,15,8,"Hey, Rach, how was work?"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,19,15,9,"Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,19,15,10,"By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff."
Rachel Green,Sad,3,19,15,11,"Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and..."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,19,15,12,Something wrong?
Rachel Green,Sad,3,19,15,13,No. Nothing.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,19,16,2,"So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,19,16,3,"Okay well, he would turn things to gold."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,19,16,4,What about things that are already gold?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,19,16,5,"Ahh, his work is done."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,19,16,6,"Okay, let's play my game now."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,19,16,7,Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,20,1,2,"Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,20,1,3,Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you?
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,20,1,4,"Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,20,1,5,"Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,20,1,6,"Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,20,1,7,Hey!
#ALL#,Joyful,3,20,1,8,Hey!
Ross Geller,Sad,3,20,1,9,"Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,20,1,10,"Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
Ross Geller,Sad,3,20,1,11,We were all pretty shaken up about it.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,20,1,12,"Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,20,1,13,"Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,20,1,14,"Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,20,1,15,You get the dollhouse.
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,20,1,16,I get the dollhouse!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,20,1,17,"Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,20,1,18,"Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,20,1,19,"No, just a barrel."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,20,1,20,"Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,20,1,21,Really?! Really?!
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,20,1,22,"Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,20,1,23,My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,20,2,2,"Hey, Sophie!"
Sophie,Joyful,3,20,2,3,"Hey, Rach!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,20,2,4,Hey.
Sophie,Neutral,3,20,2,5,Hey.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,20,2,6,"Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,20,2,7,"Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,20,2,8,"Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,20,2,9,"Yes, I realise that."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,20,2,10,Summer catalogue!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,20,2,11,That's the stuff!
Joanna,Powerful,3,20,2,13,"Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. Hello! You don't work for me."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,20,2,14,"Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna."
Joanna,Joyful,3,20,2,15,Bing! That's a great name.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,20,2,16,"Thanks, it's ah, Gaelic, for 'Thy turkey's done.' So ah, I'm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you."
Joanna,Joyful,3,20,2,17,Me too.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,20,2,18,"Bye, Chandler."
Joanna,Neutral,3,20,2,19,"So ah, what's wrong with him?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,20,2,20,"Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore."
Joanna,Scared,3,20,2,21,"Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,20,2,22,"No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!"
Joanna,Neutral,3,20,2,23,"Oh, Rachel, actually, y'know what, forget it."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,20,2,24,"Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?"
Joanna,Sad,3,20,2,25,"Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do?"
Sophie,Mad,3,20,2,26,"Uh, uh, uh, I am here."
Joanna,Powerful,3,20,2,27,I know that.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,20,4,2,"Hey, Kate!"
Kate Miller,Sad,3,20,4,3,Morning.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,20,4,4,"Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week..."
The Director,Joyful,3,20,4,5,"Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute!"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,20,4,6,"And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah..."
Woman,Neutral,3,20,4,7,"Hi, oh, I'm Lauren, Kate's understudy."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,20,4,8,"Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani."
Lauren,Joyful,3,20,4,9,I know! I-I'm a big fan of yours.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,20,4,10,What?!
Lauren,Joyful,3,20,4,11,"I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,20,4,12,"Get out of here, really?!"
Lauren,Joyful,3,20,4,13,Absolutely!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,20,4,14,Yeah?
Lauren,Sad,3,20,4,15,"Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,20,4,16,They gave me the shaft all right.
Lauren,Scared,3,20,4,17,"Oh, you're so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,20,4,18,"Well Ahh, yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great."
Lauren,Joyful,3,20,4,19,Cool! I-I'll see you then.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,20,4,20,All right.
The Director,Neutral,3,20,4,21,"All right, it's time to act, my talking props."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,20,5,2,Hey!

Ross Geller,Neutral,3,20,5,7,"Hey, what's this?!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,20,5,8,"Oh, okay, it's the slide instead of stairs. Watch this."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,20,5,9,"It's very interesting, Phoebe."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,20,5,10,What's this?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,20,5,11,"The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,20,5,12,This is the coolest house ever!!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,20,5,14,"Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,20,5,15,All right!
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,20,5,16,I would!
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,20,5,17,"Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!"

Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,20,5,23,"Hey, my Father's house does that!"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,20,5,24,"O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,20,5,25,"Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening."
Rachel Green,Scared,3,20,5,26,Hmm.
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,20,5,27,"Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!"
Joanna,Joyful,3,20,6,2,Chandler is fantastic!!
Rachel Green,Scared,3,20,6,3,What?!
Joanna,Joyful,3,20,6,4,"Oh God, we just clicked! Y'know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,20,6,5,"Oh, I...."
Joanna,Joyful,3,20,6,6,"Oh, and he's got such a good heart! Doesn't he have a good heart?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,20,6,7,"Oh, I know..."
Joanna,Joyful,3,20,6,8,"Oh, I know and he's soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through."
Sophie,Joyful,3,20,6,9,Isn't this great?!
Joanna,Peaceful,3,20,6,10,Don't spoil it.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,20,8,2,Hey.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,20,8,3,Hi.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,20,8,4,Hey.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,20,8,6,Hi.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,20,8,7,Hey.
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,20,8,9,It's a little early to be drinkin'.
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,20,8,10,"No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,20,8,11,Ohhhhh!
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,20,8,12,You're kidding?! That's great!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,20,8,13,"Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making..."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,20,8,14,Oh my.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,20,8,15,"Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,20,8,16,"I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,20,8,17,"Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,20,8,18,That's what you say at the end of a date.
Rachel Green,Mad,3,20,8,19,"You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,20,8,20,"To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,20,8,21,"Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,20,8,22,"Well, they always called."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,20,8,23,"Hmm, bite me."
Joanna,Scared,3,20,9,2,Did he call?
Rachel Green,Sad,3,20,9,3,No. Sorry.
Joanna,Mad,3,20,9,4,Why?! Why?! He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?
Sophie,Peaceful,3,20,9,5,"Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women."
Joanna,Mad,3,20,9,6,"Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,20,9,7,"Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss."
Joanna,Scared,3,20,9,8,Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,20,9,9,Well...
Joanna,Scared,3,20,9,10,"The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,20,9,11,No. I...
Joanna,Powerful,3,20,9,12,"Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,20,10,2,Call her! Call her now!
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,20,10,3,"Multiple, so many paper cuts."
Rachel Green,Scared,3,20,10,4,"Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!"
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,20,10,5,"Oh, well give me the phone then."
Rachel Green,Scared,3,20,10,6,"Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!"
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,20,10,7,"Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'"
Rachel Green,Powerful,3,20,10,8,Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,20,10,9,Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
Rachel Green,Mad,3,20,10,10,"I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!"
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,20,10,11,"All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!"
Rachel Green,Mad,3,20,10,12,That's fine!
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,20,10,13,"That's just a lot of big talk, y'know."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,20,10,14,I know.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,20,12,2,Hey.
Kate Miller,Neutral,3,20,12,3,Hi.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,20,12,4,"So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?"
Kate Miller,Neutral,3,20,12,5,About what?
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,20,12,6,"Y'know, about what happened with us."
Kate Miller,Mad,3,20,12,7,"Nooo. And there's really no reason he should find out, so ah let's not make a big deal about it, okay?"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,20,12,8,"What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you. I-I was there, you're not that good an actress."
Kate Miller,Scared,3,20,12,9,"Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That's all it was. Joey, I'm-I'm sorry you feel bad, but haven't you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?"
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,20,12,10,Nooo.
Lauren,Joyful,3,20,12,11,"Hi, Kate!"
Kate Miller,Peaceful,3,20,12,12,"Hi, Lauren."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,20,12,13,"Hi, Lauren."
Lauren,Mad,3,20,12,14,"Hi, pig!"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,20,13,2,"Sorry I ah, I scared you in there."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,20,13,3,"Oh, that's okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,20,13,4,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,20,13,5,Hey!
Monica Geller,Sad,3,20,13,6,I tried to reach you at work. There's....been a fire.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,20,13,7,What?! Oh my... Oh my God!! What happened?!
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,20,13,8,"Well, we believe it originated here. In the Aroma Room."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,20,13,9,All right. Did everyone get out okay?
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,20,13,10,"Well, the giraffe's okay. And so is the pirate."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,20,13,11,Ohh. What is this?
Ross Geller,Scared,3,20,13,12,"No Phoebe, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,20,13,13,"Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,20,14,2,"It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time."
Joanna,Joyful,3,20,14,3,"Well, thanks again for lunch."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,20,14,4,"Yes, this, this was pleasant."
Joanna,Joyful,3,20,14,6,"It was, wasn't it?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,20,14,7,"The food there was, was great."
Joanna,Joyful,3,20,14,8,Wasn't it?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,20,14,9,So take care.
Joanna,Joyful,3,20,14,10,You too.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,20,14,11,"Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime."
Joanna,Joyful,3,20,14,12,"Great! I'm looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,20,14,13,Sophie's desk.
Rachel Green,Mad,3,20,14,15,Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,20,14,16,Noo!
Rachel Green,Mad,3,20,14,17,Chandler!!
Chandler Bing,Sad,3,20,14,18,"Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm weak, and pathetic, and sorry."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,20,14,19,"Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now."
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,20,14,20,Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
Joanna,Sad,3,20,14,21,What?
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,20,14,22,"I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out."
Joanna,Sad,3,20,14,23,"Well, this isn't how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,20,14,24,"Yeah, o-okay."
Joanna,Neutral,3,20,14,25,So...
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,20,14,26,Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,21,1,2,So who's idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
Monica Geller,Mad,3,21,1,3,"Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,21,1,4,"Oh my God, they took my idea!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,21,1,5,That was you?!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,21,1,6,"Yeah! Okay, here you go."
Gunther,Neutral,3,21,1,7,"Rachel, I made you a cocoa."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,21,1,9,"Oh my God, are you guys okay?"
Gunther,Neutral,3,21,1,10,Are you all right?
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,21,1,11,Oh my.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,21,2,2,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,21,2,3,Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,21,2,4,"Oh, so that's why the priest threw holy water on me. Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,3,21,2,5,"Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy's theory. Okay?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,21,2,6,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,21,2,7,Hey.

Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,21,2,15,Thanks.
Anchorwoman,Powerful,3,21,2,16,"While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won't live to see the fourth of July. Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,21,2,17,"Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? 'Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!"

Monica Geller,Neutral,3,21,3,8,"Oh, what'd ya bring me?! Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?"
Peter Becker,Joyful,3,21,3,9,"Yeah, sure, that'd be great."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,21,3,11,Regular or decaf?
Peter Becker,Peaceful,3,21,3,12,"Ah, which ever is closest."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,21,3,13,Okay.
Peter Becker,Neutral,3,21,3,14,So ask me what I did today.
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,21,3,15,So what did you do today Pete?
Peter Becker,Peaceful,3,21,3,16,I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,21,3,17,What?! Oh.
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,21,4,2,Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
Rachel Green,Mad,3,21,4,3,What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
Monica Geller,Mad,3,21,4,4,"I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,21,4,5,And you're still not attracted to him at all?
Monica Geller,Scared,3,21,4,6,"Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,21,4,7,"Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher."
Monica Geller,Sad,3,21,4,8,"Oh, please."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,21,4,10,What? Honey.
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,21,4,11,"Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday."
Monica Geller,Sad,3,21,4,12,"Oh God, I'm so sorry."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,21,4,13,I know.
Rachel Green,Mad,3,21,4,15,Ow!!
Monica Geller,Sad,3,21,4,16,Oh God!
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,21,4,17,"Hey, you guys! Guess what?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,21,4,18,Got a job on a river boat?
Ross Geller,Powerful,3,21,4,19,"Y'know what I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so..."
Rachel Green,Powerful,3,21,4,20,"Oh I see, so this suit is making a point."
Ross Geller,Powerful,3,21,4,21,Right.

Chandler Bing,Sad,3,21,5,11,Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,21,5,12,"Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,21,5,13,"Oh, well no problem there."

Rachel Green,Neutral,3,21,8,12,"No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It's a very big deal, there's a lot of people there I have to meet."
Ross Geller,Mad,3,21,8,13,"And I'm sure you're gonna make a big impression. Hi! I'm Rachel Green. It's nice to meet you. Come on, you probably have a broken rib!"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,21,8,14,"Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it'll still be broken then."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,21,8,15,Rach...
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,21,8,16,"But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,21,8,17,Rachel...

Ross Geller,Scared,3,21,8,19,Fine. I'll go.
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,21,8,20,"Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,21,8,21,Sure. I'll help you.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,21,8,22,"Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,21,9,2,"Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?"

Ross Geller,Neutral,3,21,9,17,"Sweep, sweep...."
Rachel Green,Powerful,3,21,9,18,"Okay, now make it even, 'cause we don't..."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,21,9,19,What? What?
Rachel Green,Mad,3,21,9,20,"We don't want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,21,9,22,"No. No, y'know you don't, you don't wear enough of this. What?"
Rachel Green,Mad,3,21,9,23,"Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,21,9,24,"Well I, close your eyes, I just think you're gonna like this a little better, 'cause, close-close..."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,21,9,25,Blow it.
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,21,9,26,"Sorry. 'Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,21,9,27,Sophisticated like a hooker?

Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,21,10,11,But I can't tell you.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,21,10,12,"Okay, but wouldn't it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,21,10,13,"Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to like all my gods."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,21,10,14,Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?

Monica Geller,Scared,3,21,10,16,Does it have to do with Joey?

Monica Geller,Neutral,3,21,12,12,What is it?! What about Pete?

Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,21,12,17,"I, but you're so close! No!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,21,12,18,"Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete's computer company?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,21,12,19,"Oh, just go. You're never gonna get it!"

Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,21,13,6,"I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?"
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,21,13,8,"If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,21,13,9,"Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,21,13,10,Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,3,21,13,11,"That's horrible! Well, you did the right thing man."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,21,13,12,"Thanks, I'm glad you see it that way."

Peter Becker,Joyful,3,21,14,11,"Now, nooo! I'm just excited about the restaurant, that's all."
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,21,14,12,Pete.
Peter Becker,Joyful,3,21,14,13,"Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,21,14,14,"No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. It's-it's really nice."
Peter Becker,Peaceful,3,21,14,15,"Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I'm okay with that."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,21,14,16,"You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job."
Peter Becker,Neutral,3,21,14,17,What?
Monica Geller,Sad,3,21,14,18,"And well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore. I'm sorry."
Peter Becker,Sad,3,21,14,19,"Okay, yeah. I mean... If that's, if that's really what you want, okay."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,21,14,20,"Okay, bye."

I'm gonna get on this spaceship, and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her."

Monica Geller,Scared,3,22,13,2,"Phoebe, it's been two days."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,22,13,3,"Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it's one of those 801 numbers. Right?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,22,13,4,"Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,22,13,5,"No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it's has to be 800. 'Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one. Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,22,13,6,Phoe-be!!
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,22,13,7,"Sorry, I'm so sorry, I will pay you back."
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,22,13,8,"And yet, she's still not hanging up the phone."
#ALL#,Powerful,3,22,13,9,Hang it up! Hang up the phone!!
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,22,13,10,Fine! Fine! Oh-oh!

Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,22,13,12,"Well, I think I broke it. But that's all right, here's the number you can call."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,22,13,13,Oh.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,23,1,2,"Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,23,1,3,Or... Dick.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,23,1,4,Hey.
Ross Geller,Scared,3,23,1,6,"Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,23,1,7,Was it like a sneeze only better?
Ross Geller,Scared,3,23,1,8,"No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,23,1,9,What was it?
Ross Geller,Scared,3,23,1,10,"Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out."
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,23,1,12,No!!
Ross Geller,Scared,3,23,1,13,"Come on you guys, it's no big deal!"
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,23,1,14,Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! Huh.
Ross Geller,Scared,3,23,1,15,Well what is it? Is it a mole?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,23,1,16,"No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,23,1,17,"Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,23,1,18,"No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a..."
Rachel Green,Scared,3,23,1,19,Hey guys! What's...
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,23,1,20,"Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,23,1,21,Ahhh.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,23,1,22,"Yeah, right."
Jason,Joyful,3,23,3,2,"...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,23,3,3,"That is so great! Oh, I... Oh my God!"
Jason,Joyful,3,23,3,4,Whoa!
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,23,3,5,Oh my God!!!
Jason,Scared,3,23,3,6,"Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,23,3,7,No! No!
Jason,Scared,3,23,3,8,"No, no?"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,23,3,9,"Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!"
Jason,Scared,3,23,3,10,W-w-w-wait! Why?!
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,23,3,11,"Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay?"
Ross Geller,Scared,3,23,4,2,"Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!"
Dr. Rhodes,Scared,3,23,4,3,"Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. What are you doing?"
Ross Geller,Scared,3,23,4,4,Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
Dr. Rhodes,Neutral,3,23,4,5,Well that's not a third nipple.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,23,4,6,No?
Dr. Rhodes,Powerful,3,23,4,7,"First of all, it's on your ass."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,23,4,8,"Well then, what is it?!"
Dr. Rhodes,Neutral,3,23,4,9,"Wait a minute, hold it. Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?"
Dr. Johnson,Neutral,3,23,4,10,I'm with Hamilton!
Dr. Rhodes,Neutral,3,23,4,11,"He's good with rear things, bring him in too."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,23,5,2,"I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,23,5,3,"Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,23,5,4,"Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,23,5,5,"...and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,23,5,6,"Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?"
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,23,5,7,Uh.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,23,5,8,"Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,23,5,9,"Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,23,5,10,"So Pheebs, pick one of them."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,23,5,11,Yeah. Which one do you like more?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,23,5,12,"Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,23,5,13,"Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,23,5,14,"Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,23,5,15,"Well sensitive is important, pick him."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,23,5,16,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,23,5,17,"Oh sure, go with the sissy."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,23,5,18,Jason is not a sissy!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,23,5,19,"Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,23,8,2,"Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, ""Look how much money we've got!"" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,23,8,3,"Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,23,8,4,"Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,23,8,5,"Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,23,8,6,Monica's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.
Rachel Green,Mad,3,23,8,7,"Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,23,8,9,All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,23,8,10,"Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,23,8,11,"Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice butt. Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!"
#ALL#,Peaceful,3,23,8,12,Good luck!
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,23,8,14,"OH MY GOD!!! Sorry, I was just imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,23,9,2,"Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?"
Fireman,Neutral,3,23,9,3,Oh sure. Vince?!
Vince,Joyful,3,23,9,4,Yo!!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,23,9,5,Wow! I didn't know you guys actually used those.
Vince,Neutral,3,23,9,6,"So, what's up?"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,23,9,7,"Umm, wow. This-this isn't gonna be easy. Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore."
Vince,Sad,3,23,9,8,Uh-huh. G-good deal.
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,23,9,9,I'm sorry.
Vince,Sad,3,23,9,10,"No-no it's okay. It's just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and... That there's so much in me I have to share with you yet."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,23,9,11,"Oh my God, I didn't..."
Vince,Sad,3,23,9,12,"I'm sorry, I can't talk. I'm gonna go write in my journal."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,23,9,13,Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,23,10,2,"I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,23,10,3,"Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,23,10,4,"Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,23,10,5,Gimme this.
Rachel Green,Scared,3,23,10,6,"Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,23,10,7,Brides magazines?
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,23,10,8,"Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,23,10,9,"Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,23,10,10,"It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,23,10,11,Oh my God.
Monica Geller,Sad,3,23,10,12,I know. I need more pie.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,23,10,13,"Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,23,10,14,You didn't break up with that fireman?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,23,10,15,"No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,23,10,16,Wow!
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,23,10,17,"Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,23,10,18,"So then, are you going to dump Jason?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,23,10,19,"Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and... Okay so Jason is sensitive, but now so's Vince Plus, Vince has the body y'know? So... It's really just about the math."
Guru Saj,Peaceful,3,23,12,2,You must be Ross.
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,23,12,3,Hi.
Guru Saj,Peaceful,3,23,12,4,I am Guru Saj.
Ross Geller,Scared,3,23,12,5,"Listen, I got to tell you I've-I've never been to a guru before, so..."
Guru Saj,Joyful,3,23,12,6,"Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I've attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours. Come on, have a seat. Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it's a koondis!"
Ross Geller,Scared,3,23,12,7,What's a koondis?
Guru Saj,Joyful,3,23,12,8,"I don't know, what's a koondis with you? Please, lie down! I've got a sav that oughta shrink that right up."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,23,12,9,I guess it's worth a try.
Guru Saj,Scared,3,23,12,10,"Oh sure, we should see results-Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!!"
Ross Geller,Scared,3,23,12,11,What?! What?!
Guru Saj,Peaceful,3,23,12,12,We appear to have angered it.
Ross Geller,Mad,3,23,12,13,We?! We angered it?!
Guru Saj,Peaceful,3,23,12,14,"Oh, I think I see the problem. And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool. Love."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,23,12,15,Oh God!
Guru Saj,Powerful,3,23,12,16,"Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to..."
Ross Geller,Mad,3,23,12,17,Ow!!
Guru Saj,Sad,3,23,12,18,Oops.
Ross Geller,Scared,3,23,12,19,"What was, what was that?"
Guru Saj,Neutral,3,23,12,20,Well it's gone.
Ross Geller,Mad,3,23,12,21,What?! How's that?
Guru Saj,Neutral,3,23,12,22,It got caught on my watch.
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,23,12,23,Hey!
Peter Becker,Joyful,3,23,13,2,"Lights. Uh, romantic lights."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,23,13,3,"Ooh, nice."
Peter Becker,Peaceful,3,23,13,4,"So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,23,13,5,"Oh, right! I completely forgot about that."
Peter Becker,Peaceful,3,23,13,6,"Well ah, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life..."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,23,13,7,Yeah?
Peter Becker,Joyful,3,23,13,8,"And I feel like I've conquered the business world, and I feel like I've conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,23,13,9,Wow.
Peter Becker,Powerful,3,23,13,10,There's one thing missing.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,23,13,11,What's that?
Peter Becker,Powerful,3,23,13,12,It's time for me to conquer the physical world.
Monica Geller,Scared,3,23,13,13,Okay.
Peter Becker,Powerful,3,23,13,14,"Monica, I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,23,13,15,You wanna what?!
Peter Becker,Powerful,3,23,13,16,"I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It's the most intense physical competition in the world, it's banned in 49 states!"
Monica Geller,Scared,3,23,13,17,What are you talking about?
Peter Becker,Powerful,3,23,13,18,"Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I've even had my own octagon training ring designed."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,23,13,19,And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
Peter Becker,Powerful,3,23,13,20,"Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,23,13,21,My parents will be so happy.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,23,14,2,"""Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear..."" Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show."
Jason,Scared,3,23,14,4,Hey. I was...
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,23,14,5,Hey!
Jason,Joyful,3,23,14,6,"I was passin' by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it's kinda cool seeing you up there."
Vince,Mad,3,23,14,7,Whoa! Hey-hey! What's going on here? Who is this guy?
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,23,14,8,"I don't know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!"
Vince,Mad,3,23,14,9,What?!
Jason,Scared,3,23,14,10,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,23,14,11,"Yeah, okay, I've-I've been dating both of you, and it's been really horrible. 'Cause y'know it's been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn't know how to chose, so... I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm terrible, I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible."
Vince,Peaceful,3,23,14,12,"Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it's okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive."
Jason,Peaceful,3,23,14,13,"Yeah, and neither did we. Give yourself a break."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,23,14,14,Really?!
Jason,Peaceful,3,23,14,15,"Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven't been going out that long. Come on, we haven't even slept together yet. Huh."
Vince,Peaceful,3,23,14,16,You haven't?
Jason,Peaceful,3,23,14,17,You have?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,23,14,18,"Well, this is none of my business."
Jason,Mad,3,23,14,19,I-I can't believe this! You-you've slept with him?!
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,23,14,20,"Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park."
Jason,Mad,3,23,14,21,"Y'know Phoebe, I'm gonna make this real easy for you."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,23,14,22,"Well, that could've been really awkward."
Vince,Mad,3,23,14,23,You made him a candle light dinner in the park?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,23,14,24,"Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you."
Vince,Mad,3,23,14,25,"Uh yeah, I can't believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,24,2,2,"So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,24,2,3,"No-no-no oh, keep your name, don't take his name."
Monica Geller,Sad,3,24,2,4,He didn't ask me to marry him.
#ALL#,Sad,3,24,2,5,Ohh.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,24,2,6,Well then definately don't take his name.
Monica Geller,Sad,3,24,2,7,He wanted to tell me he's gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
The Guys,Mad,3,24,2,8,Pete?!
Rachel Green,Mad,3,24,2,9,Why?! What is it?
Monica Geller,Scared,3,24,2,10,I don't know exactly. It's-it's sorta like wrestling.
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,24,2,11,Oh?!
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,24,2,12,"Yeah, but without the costumes."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,24,2,13,Oh.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,24,2,14,"And it's not fake, it's totally brutal."
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,24,2,15,"Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are ""There are no rules."""
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,24,2,16,"So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?"
Ross Geller,Powerful,3,24,2,17,"Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,24,2,18,What's fish hooking?
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,24,2,19,"Huh, what's fish hooking... Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,24,2,20,"What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath."
Doug,Joyful,3,24,3,2,"So thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let's go out there and get 'em! Huh? And remember, there is no 'I' in team."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,24,3,3,"Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office."
Doug,Joyful,3,24,3,4,You! Chuckles! What's your name?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,24,3,5,"Oh it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry , I was just ah..."
Doug,Joyful,3,24,3,6,"No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. This team is about hard work, but it's also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing!"
Hoshi,Powerful,3,24,5,2,"You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?"
Peter Becker,Joyful,3,24,5,3,"I told you, we're adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?"
Hoshi,Mad,3,24,5,4,It's just hard when I know I have e-mail I can't get!
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,24,5,5,Hi!
Peter Becker,Joyful,3,24,5,6,Monica! Hi honey.
Hoshi,Neutral,3,24,5,7,"All right, on the table."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,24,5,8,"Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you."
Peter Becker,Scared,3,24,5,9,"Oh, believe me, I don't want to get hurt either. I'm being smart about this. See these guys? They're the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. A house painter! He used to be a house painter."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,24,5,10,Promise me you'll be careful.
Peter Becker,Peaceful,3,24,5,11,I promise.
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,24,5,12,"Hey, are we still on for tonight?"
Peter Becker,Neutral,3,24,5,13,Yeah.
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,24,5,14,"Okay, good, 'cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own..."
Hoshi,Mad,3,24,5,15,No! No boom-boom before big fight!
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,24,5,16,How 'bout just a boom?
Rachel Green,Sad,3,24,6,2,"Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,24,6,3,Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
Bonnie,Neutral,3,24,6,4,Hi!
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,24,6,5,This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
Bonnie,Joyful,3,24,6,6,I can show you an ID if you want?
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,24,6,7,"Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you."
Bonnie,Powerful,3,24,6,8,"Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,24,6,9,"Oh, that must be it."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,24,6,10,Well I hope you have fun tonight.
Bonnie,Joyful,3,24,6,11,Thanks! You too.
Rachel Green,Mad,3,24,6,14,You said she was bald.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,24,6,15,"Yeah, she was bald, she's not now."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,24,6,16,How could you not tell me that she has hair?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,24,6,17,"I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,24,6,18,"Ohh, well, this is just perfect!"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,24,6,19,"Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,24,6,20,"Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,24,6,21,"Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,24,6,22,"Why, does she have a bad personality?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,24,6,23,"Oh no, Bonnie's the best!"
Doug,Joyful,3,24,7,2,"Bing! Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. Wham! Good one. That was a good one. Keep at it team."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,24,7,3,What is with him?
Phil,Peaceful,3,24,7,4,"With him? You're is favourite, you're his guy!"
Stevens,Mad,3,24,7,5,We never get smacked.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,3,24,7,6,"Well, that's not true, he-he smacked you once."
Phil,Peaceful,3,24,7,7,"Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me."
Stevens,Scared,3,24,7,8,"I'm telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall."
Doug,Powerful,3,24,7,9,Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,24,7,10,No sir.
Doug,Powerful,3,24,7,11,There you go.
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,24,8,2,Hey!
Monica Geller,Scared,3,24,8,3,"God Ross, what is that?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,24,8,4,"Yeah, it's the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!"
Announcer,Joyful,3,24,8,5,"From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He's known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,24,8,7,"I love you, Pete!!!"
Announcer,Joyful,3,24,8,8,"And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He's a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!"
Monica Geller,Scared,3,24,8,10,Pete! Pete!! That guy's pretty huge!
Peter Becker,Powerful,3,24,8,11,"Don't worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent's strength and weight against him."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,24,8,12,"Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,24,8,14,All right! You go get him! Let's go!
Referee,Joyful,3,24,8,15,"Here we go gentlemen, here we go! Are you ready? Are you ready? Let's get it on!!"
Peter Becker,Scared,3,24,8,17,Uh-oh.
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,24,9,2,Hey! It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
Peter Becker,Peaceful,3,24,9,3,"It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant ""You suck!"""
Monica Geller,Mad,3,24,9,4,"I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets."
Peter Becker,Peaceful,3,24,9,5,"What, look back?"
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,24,9,6,"Well, you're not gonna get going are you?"
Peter Becker,Peaceful,3,24,9,7,Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,24,9,8,"Well, no. But..."
Peter Becker,Powerful,3,24,9,9,Well I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
Monica Geller,Scared,3,24,9,10,That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
Peter Becker,Powerful,3,24,9,11,"Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad's garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,24,9,12,You didn't know that already?
Peter Becker,Powerful,3,24,9,13,"Look, I'm gonna get better. Okay? I promise you."
Monica Geller,Powerful,3,24,9,14,"Okay, just get a lot better. Fast."
Peter Becker,Sad,3,24,9,15,"Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,24,9,16,Yeah. That-that was the problem.
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,24,10,2,Hey.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,24,10,3,Hey! How long until Pete's fight?
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,24,10,4,"Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,24,10,5,Hot dog?
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,24,10,6,"Four, please. I'm really nervous. Thank you."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,24,10,7,"So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,24,10,8,"What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,24,10,9,"Ohh, that's too bad!"
Ross Geller,Scared,3,24,10,10,"No, I-I'm saying I liked her."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,24,10,11,"Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,24,10,12,"Pheebs, I think she's great. Okay? We're going out again."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,24,10,13,"Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?"
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,24,10,14,Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,24,10,15,"Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,24,10,16,"Hey, the fight's starting!"
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,24,10,17,"Okay, we'll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,24,10,18,"Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,3,24,10,19,Fight's over!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,24,11,2,"Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!"
Doug,Joyful,3,24,11,3,Bing! You got those numbers for me?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,24,11,4,"No, I ah, I didn't do them."
Doug,Sad,3,24,11,5,"Oh, you forgot?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,24,11,6,"No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise."
Doug,Joyful,3,24,11,7,"Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. That's okay, you're still my number one guy! Bing!"
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,24,11,8,Doug!!
Doug,Neutral,3,24,11,9,Hmm.
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,24,11,10,I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
Doug,Mad,3,24,11,11,"Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!"
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,24,11,12,"No, no. It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock."
Doug,Neutral,3,24,11,13,Oh?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,24,11,14,"Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous."
Doug,Joyful,3,24,11,15,"Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You're okay."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,24,11,16,Okay.
Doug,Joyful,3,24,11,17,Ha! Ahhhhhhh!
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,24,11,18,Ahhhhh!
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,24,12,2,"Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?"
Rachel Green,Mad,3,24,12,3,"Oh my God! Phoebe look, it's Ross and that girl."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,24,12,5,No! No! Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,24,12,6,Phoebe!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,24,12,7,"Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,24,12,8,"Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh..."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,24,12,9,"Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive."
Rachel Green,Mad,3,24,12,10,"Ohh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he's gonna marry her, and this is all your fault."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,24,12,11,You said it was okay!
Rachel Green,Mad,3,24,12,12,You said she was bald!!
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,24,12,13,What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!
Rachel Green,Mad,3,24,12,14,"Phoebe, we can't, we just can't just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,24,12,15,"Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don't get it. Aren't you the one that decided that you didn't want to be with Ross?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,24,12,16,Yes.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,24,12,17,Well isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy?
Rachel Green,Sad,3,24,12,18,Yes.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,24,12,19,So?
Rachel Green,Sad,3,24,12,20,"I just y'know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh!"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,24,12,21,Oh no.
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,24,12,22,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,24,12,23,"Oh, we killed them all."
Rachel Green,Scared,3,24,12,24,Oh!
Peter Becker,Joyful,3,24,13,2,"It's okay, it's not as bad as it looks, it's a precaution. Ah, I'm not supposed to move my spine."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,24,13,3,Please tell me you're stopping now.
Peter Becker,Peaceful,3,24,13,4,"I'm fine! I'd fight tonight, if they'd let me. See this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone of terror."
Monica Geller,Scared,3,24,13,5,You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
Peter Becker,Joyful,3,24,13,6,"I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,24,13,7,"Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!"
Peter Becker,Scared,3,24,13,8,"Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,24,13,9,"Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me."
Peter Becker,Neutral,3,24,13,10,"Well if you're asking me to quit, then you're asking me to be someone I'm not. I've got to do this."
Monica Geller,Sad,3,24,13,11,Then I've gotta go. Bye.
Peter Becker,Scared,3,24,13,12,Mon-Monica?
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,24,13,13,Yes?
Peter Becker,Peaceful,3,24,13,14,"Could you leave a note? 'Cause I'm on a lot of pain killers now, and I don't know if I'll remember this tomorrow."
Doug,Joyful,3,24,14,2,"So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so I'm happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. Phil! Nice job. Stevens! Way to go! Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya! Bing! Good job, couldn't have done it without ya."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,24,14,3,"Thank you, sir."
Stevens,Neutral,3,24,14,4,"Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident."
Doug,Neutral,3,24,14,5,"Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! Well, what about you? You're not feeling left out or anything are ya?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,24,14,6,"No. No, not at all, that's-that's ridiculous."
Doug,Neutral,3,24,14,7,"Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,24,14,8,"Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!"
Doug,Joyful,3,24,14,9,"Now get on out of here, you!"
Tv Announcer,Neutral,3,24,15,2,"Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just..."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,3,24,15,3,"Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!"
Rachel Green,Scared,3,24,15,4,"Oh, I can't watch this."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,24,15,5,"Check it out, he's winning! Pete's winning!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,24,15,6,Really?!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,24,15,7,No-o-o!!
Tv Announcer,Sad,3,24,15,8,"Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area."
#ALL#,Scared,3,24,15,9,Oh! Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,24,15,10,"Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,24,15,11,"Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't."
#ALL#,Joyful,3,24,15,12,Ohh!!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,25,1,2,"So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!"
Bonnie,Powerful,3,25,1,3,"All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,3,25,1,4,Tell it again. Seriously.
Rachel Green,Mad,3,25,1,6,I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,25,1,7,"Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography."
Monica Geller,Mad,3,25,1,8,"Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,3,25,1,9,"Well, I think we all learned something."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,25,1,10,"Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,25,1,11,"Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,25,1,12,Y'know what that means?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,25,1,13,That you're actually 50?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,25,1,14,"No-no, that's not, that's not me Phoebe, that's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. Best Friends Forever."
#ALL#,Joyful,3,25,1,15,Oh!
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,25,1,16,That is so cool.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,25,1,17,"I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?"
#ALL#,Joyful,3,25,1,18,"Yeah! Yeah, we can!"
Bonnie,Sad,3,25,1,19,"Shoot! I can't go, I have to work!"
Ross Geller,Sad,3,25,1,20,That's too bad.
Rachel Green,Sad,3,25,1,21,"Ohh, big, fat bummerrr."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,25,1,22,So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,25,1,23,"Hey, Bonnie had sex there!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,25,3,2,"Go, go, go!"
Rachel Green,Powerful,3,25,3,3,"Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!"
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,25,3,5,Oy!!
Monica Geller,Peaceful,3,25,3,6,What's with all this sand?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,25,3,7,"Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage."
Ross Geller,Neutral,3,25,3,8,"Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat."
Phoebe Abbott,Joyful,3,25,4,2,"Well, yes, it's kind've an unusual house. It has umm, three beautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But y'know, the ocean is right there."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,25,4,3,"Knock, knock, knock."
Phoebe Abbott,Neutral,3,25,4,4,"Ah, oh, hang on a second. Come in, come in. All right, so think about it, and call me back."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,25,4,5,"Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?"
Phoebe Abbott,Scared,3,25,4,6,"Ahh, yes."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,25,4,7,"Hi Phoebe Abott, I'm your best friends daughter!"
Phoebe Abbott,Joyful,3,25,4,8,You're Erwin's daughter?!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,25,4,9,"No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here. Lily, from high school. Remember?"
Phoebe Abbott,Joyful,3,25,4,10,"Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I... Then you must be?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,25,4,11,"Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess."
Phoebe Abbott,Joyful,3,25,4,12,"Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! There's Frank."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,25,4,13,"Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That's my Dad, that's Frank! Yeah! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy."
Phoebe Abbott,Joyful,3,25,4,14,"Take it easy--if you want, there's cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria! I can make sangria!"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,25,4,15,"No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks."
Phoebe Abbott,Neutral,3,25,4,16,Oh.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,25,4,17,"Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I've been, I've been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?"
Phoebe Abbott,Neutral,3,25,4,18,"Oh no, I-I'm sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,25,4,19,"Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything."
Phoebe Abbott,Neutral,3,25,4,20,"Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,25,4,21,"Oh, what? What was it?"
Phoebe Abbott,Sad,3,25,4,22,"The three losers. Oh, poor Lily. Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,3,25,4,23,"Yeah, no, it was great."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,25,6,2,"So, you still don't think I'm boyfriend material?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,25,6,3,Huh?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,25,6,4,I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,25,6,5,You didn't even take off your pants.
Chandler Bing,Mad,3,25,6,6,"Yeah, well, lucky for you."
Monica Geller,Neutral,3,25,6,7,What?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,25,6,8,I don't know.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,25,6,9,Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,25,6,10,Shhh! Shhhh! Joey's asleep.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,3,25,6,12,"After he passed out, we put the sand around him to keep him warm."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,25,6,13,"Well I assume the ah, happy couple isn't up yet. Did you guys hear them last night?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,3,25,6,14,"Oh, yeah, I don't know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house."
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,25,6,16,Good morning.
#ALL#,Neutral,3,25,6,17,Hey.
Bonnie,Joyful,3,25,6,18,Hey! How did everybody sleep?
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,25,6,19,"Oh, great."
Monica Geller,Joyful,3,25,6,20,Like a log.
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,25,6,22,I'm going for a walk.
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,25,6,24,Good morning. Nice breasts by the way.
Bonnie,Neutral,3,25,7,2,"Hey, what happened to you?"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,3,25,7,3,"Oh, ah nothin'. I just felt like hangin' out here and reading."
Bonnie,Joyful,3,25,7,4,"Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came off."
Rachel Green,Sad,3,25,7,5,"Ohhhh, sorry I missed that."
Bonnie,Joyful,3,25,7,6,"Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,25,7,7,Ohh-ha-ha!
Bonnie,Joyful,3,25,7,8,I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.
Rachel Green,Powerful,3,25,7,9,"Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald."
Bonnie,Joyful,3,25,7,10,Really?!
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,25,7,11,Ohh!
Bonnie,Joyful,3,25,7,12,Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,25,7,13,Really?!
Bonnie,Joyful,3,25,7,14,Yeah!
Rachel Green,Powerful,3,25,7,15,I mean you definitely should do that.
Bonnie,Joyful,3,25,7,16,"Y'know what, I should do it."
Rachel Green,Joyful,3,25,7,17,Yeah!
Bonnie,Joyful,3,25,7,18,"Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool."
Rachel Green,Neutral,3,25,7,19,"Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!"
Bonnie,Joyful,3,25,7,20,All right.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,3,25,8,2,"What's the matter, Pheebs?"
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,25,8,3,She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,3,25,8,4,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,25,8,5,"Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She's avoiding me, she doesn't want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won't tell me."
Rachel Green,Sad,3,25,8,6,"Aww Pheebs, that sucks!"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,25,8,7,"Yeah, well, don't ""Aww Pheebs, that sucks!"" me yet."
Chandler Bing,Scared,3,25,8,8,Where ya going?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,25,8,9,"Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is."
Ross Geller,Scared,3,25,8,10,"Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,25,8,11,"Well, are any of those people here?!"
#ALL#,Scared,3,25,8,12,"Oh, no!! No, no!"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,25,8,13,"Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays."
Bonnie,Peaceful,3,25,8,15,"Hey, everybody!"
#ALL#,Scared,3,25,8,16,Wow!!
Ross Geller,Joyful,3,25,8,17,Wh-haa-haa! Look what 'cha did!
Bonnie,Peaceful,3,25,8,18,You wanna touch it?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,25,8,19,"Nooo, but it, but it's great."
Bonnie,Peaceful,3,25,8,20,"Come on, touch it!"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,3,25,8,21,Okay. You can feel all the bones in your skull.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,25,10,3,"Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay. Oh, shhh!"
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,3,25,10,5,No! No!! It's me! It's me! I-I didn't want to make any noise!
Phoebe Abbott,Mad,3,25,10,6,Then don't break in!!
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,25,10,7,I'm sorry.
Phoebe Abbott,Powerful,3,25,10,8,What are you doing here?!
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,25,10,9,"I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays."
Phoebe Abbott,Powerful,3,25,10,10,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,3,25,10,11,"Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you're just mean! So, just tell me the truth!"
Phoebe Abbott,Neutral,3,25,10,12,"All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,3,25,10,13,My Father is Chuck Magioni?
Phoebe Abbott,Peaceful,3,25,10,14,"No, no, that's just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! And I'm very sorry, but I don't know where your Father is, and that's the truth."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,3,25,10,15,Oh.
Phoebe Abbott,Peaceful,3,25,10,16,"But umm, you're right. I think that a person should know where they come from. Wh-which is why I ah, ahh, okay. I'm your mother."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,3,25,10,17,Heh?
Phoebe Abbott,Neutral,3,25,10,18,"Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and..."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,3,25,11,2,"I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!"

Rachel Green,Neutral,4,1,1,18,"Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood?"
Ross Geller,Scared,4,1,1,19,"No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn't work either, I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her..."
Rachel Green,Scared,4,1,1,20,Whoa-ho.
Ross Geller,Scared,4,1,1,21,"Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,1,1,22,I don't know.

Ross Geller,Neutral,4,1,1,26,Okay.
Phoebe Abbott,Powerful,4,1,2,2,So I guess you'd like to know how it all happened.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,1,2,3,"I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!"
Phoebe Abbott,Sad,4,1,2,4,"Noo! No! It wasn't like that I... Remember how I told you how Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,1,2,5,How close?
Phoebe Abbott,Powerful,4,1,2,6,"Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,1,2,7,I don't even know how that would work!
Phoebe Abbott,Joyful,4,1,2,8,"Well, we were..."

Phoebe Abbott,Scared,4,1,2,10,"Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it's like to be eighteen years old?"
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,4,1,2,11,"Yeah. Let's see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand."
Phoebe Abbott,Sad,4,1,2,12,"Well, I'm so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn't even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don't know, you're here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,1,2,13,"Yeah, well, everybody does! I'm a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn't even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I'm just, I'm gonna do the same thing to you."
Phoebe Abbott,Sad,4,1,2,14,Wait!

Rachel Green,Joyful,4,1,4,3,"Oh, was it awful?"
Ross Geller,Sad,4,1,4,4,"Well, it was loong. I didn't even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head. Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,1,4,6,I wrote you a letter.
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,1,4,7,Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,1,4,8,"It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff."
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,1,4,9,"Okay. Wow, it's-it's 5:30 in the morning. So, I'd better get cracking on this baby."

Rachel Green,Scared,4,1,5,9,Does it?
Ross Geller,Scared,4,1,5,10,"Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance."
Rachel Green,Mad,4,1,5,11,"What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it..."
Ross Geller,Scared,4,1,5,12,"No, Rach, no. I don't, I don't, I don't have to think about it, in fact, I've decided, I've decided that, that it.......does."

Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,1,6,21,"Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,1,6,22,"Y'know what, he's right. There's something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,1,6,23,Well forget it! It doesn't hurt that baaad!!!!

Chandler Bing,Mad,4,1,8,3,"Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you!"
Ross Geller,Mad,4,1,8,4,"Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, ""If you accept full responsibility..."" Full responsibility! ""...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. Does it?!!"""
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,1,8,5,No?
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,1,8,6,"Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,1,8,7,"Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you're right. Yeah I guess I'll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,1,8,8,"Sure, it's hard to forget! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about."
Ross Geller,Mad,4,1,8,9,What the hell happened on that beach?!
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,1,8,10,"It's between us and the sea, Ross!"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,1,9,2,"Hi, Ursula."

Ursula Buffay,Neutral,4,1,9,11,Yeah. So how have you been doing?
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,4,1,9,12,"I, umm, shut up!"
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,4,1,9,14,"""Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk."" You just wrote this!"
Ursula Buffay,Powerful,4,1,9,15,"Well, it's pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?"

Phoebe Abbott,Peaceful,4,1,11,3,"I'll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there hasn't been a day where I didn't regret giving you up."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,1,11,4,"Okay, bye."
Phoebe Abbott,Sad,4,1,11,5,"No, I'm not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the reason I didn't look you up was, well I was afraid that you'd react, just well like, the way, the way you're reacting right now, and can't we just, y'know, start from here?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,1,11,6,No.
Phoebe Abbott,Powerful,4,1,11,7,"Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family. I'm family, I'm it. Now, now I'm done."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,1,11,8,"But, it's not like we're losing anything. Y'know?"
Phoebe Abbott,Peaceful,4,1,11,9,"Yeah, I guess you're right."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,4,1,11,10,It's not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.
Phoebe Abbott,Joyful,4,1,11,11,"Well, I don't know. I mean it's not like we don't have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,1,11,12,I-I like pizza!
Phoebe Abbott,Powerful,4,1,11,13,"You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,1,11,14,"Oh my God, so do I!"
Phoebe Abbott,Powerful,4,1,11,15,"I knew it, wow!!"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,1,11,16,"Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?"
Phoebe Abbott,Peaceful,4,1,11,17,"Ohh, so cute."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,4,1,11,18,"Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I'm-I'm mad at you."
Phoebe Abbott,Mad,4,1,11,19,I know. I'm mad at me too.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,1,11,20,"Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry."
Phoebe Abbott,Powerful,4,1,11,21,Hey! Me too!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,1,11,22,"All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out."
Rachel Green,Sad,4,1,12,2,"Oh-hooo, I missed you."
Ross Geller,Sad,4,1,12,3,I missed you too.
Rachel Green,Scared,4,1,12,4,"Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know?"
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,1,12,5,I suppose.
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,1,12,6,"You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, ""Once a cheater, always a cheater."""
Ross Geller,Mad,4,1,12,7,Umm-hmm.
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,1,12,8,"Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective..."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,1,12,10,WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,1,12,11,Coffee house?
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,1,12,12,You bet.
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,1,12,14,"And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!"
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,1,12,15,"Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!"
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,1,12,16,I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn't finish the whole letter!
Rachel Green,Scared,4,1,12,17,What?!!
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,1,12,18,I fell asleep!
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,1,12,19,You fell asleep?!
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,1,12,20,"It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means 'you are,' Y-O-U-R means 'your!'"
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,1,12,21,Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,1,12,22,FINE BY ME!!
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,1,12,23,"Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!"
Monica Geller,Sad,4,1,12,24,Hey!!
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,1,12,25,Sorry!! I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me!
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,1,12,26,"Oh, no-no-no don't you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,1,12,27,"And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common! It doesn't happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,1,12,28,I KNEW IT!!!!
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,1,13,2,Gin.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,1,13,3,"We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked."
Monica Geller,Mad,4,1,13,4,Will you stop!
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,1,13,5,Okay. All right.
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,1,13,6,"Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,1,14,1,Gin.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,1,14,2,"We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked."
Monica Geller,Scared,4,1,14,3,Will you stop!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,1,14,4,Okay. All right.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,1,14,5,"Okay, all right, I think you're great, I think you're sweet, and you're smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,2,1,2,Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,2,1,3,"How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide."
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,2,1,4,"You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,2,1,5,"Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,2,1,6,"All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,2,1,7,"All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,2,1,8,Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
Chip Matthews,Joyful,4,2,2,2,"Hey Monica, it's Chip."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,2,2,3,Yesss!!
Ross Geller,Scared,4,2,2,4,Who's Chip?
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,2,2,5,Shhh!
Chip Matthews,Neutral,4,2,2,6,"Good runnin' into you at the bank today, so ah, here's my number, 555-9323. Give me a call. Later."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,2,2,7,"Chip, is Chip Matthews."
Ross Geller,Scared,4,2,2,8,The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,2,2,9,"'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute."
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,2,2,10,"Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!!"
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,2,2,11,"I know!! Chip? Hi! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. Okay. Okay, good-bye. Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!!"
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,2,2,12,I was just leaving.
Rachel Green,Sad,4,2,2,13,"Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep."
Ross Geller,Scared,4,2,2,14,Why? Did you write it?
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,2,2,15,"Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?"
Ross Geller,Scared,4,2,2,16,"Well ah, actually..."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,2,2,17,I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,2,2,18,"Well, umm, why don't you give him a call?"
Rachel Green,Scared,4,2,2,19,Okay. Are you sure you wanna hear this?
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,2,2,20,"Oh, I'm sure."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,2,2,21,"Chip! Hi, it's Rachel. Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. Monica Geller. Ohh."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,2,2,22,"Oh, that's right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that's gotta be embarrassing!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,2,4,2,Hey!
Rachel Green,Mad,4,2,4,3,"Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?"
Monica Geller,Scared,4,2,4,4,Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
Rachel Green,Mad,4,2,4,5,Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
Monica Geller,Scared,4,2,4,6,"What, that little thing at the prom?"
Rachel Green,Mad,4,2,4,7,Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Monica Geller,Scared,4,2,4,8,"Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?"
Rachel Green,Mad,4,2,4,9,"I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,2,4,10,"Look, you and I went to different high schools..."
Rachel Green,Mad,4,2,4,11,"Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school."
Monica Geller,Sad,4,2,4,12,"You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made."
Rachel Green,Sad,4,2,4,13,They had to have that specially made?!
Monica Geller,Sad,4,2,4,14,It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Rachel Green,Scared,4,2,4,15,"Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!"
Monica Geller,Sad,4,2,4,16,"Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,2,4,17,"Oh, you go out with him."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,2,4,18,"Oh, really?!"
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,2,4,19,"Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?"
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,2,4,20,I'll try.
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,2,5,2,So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,2,5,3,"Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,2,5,4,"Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,4,2,5,5,"Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive."
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,2,5,6,"So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,2,5,7,"Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced. Well, that's not gonna happen is it? Noo. Okay, I have to return a call in the other room."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,2,5,8,Why can't you use the phone in here?
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,2,5,9,"Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,2,5,10,"So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,2,5,11,"Ross, don't start."
Ross Geller,Sad,4,2,5,12,"Come on, you-you can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,2,5,13,I believe it.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,2,5,14,No you don't.
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,2,5,15,"Yes, I do."
Ross Geller,Mad,4,2,5,16,"No you do-y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this."
Rachel Green,Mad,4,2,5,17,"Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,2,5,18,"I do not always have to be-okay, okay."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,2,5,19,Jurassic Park could happen.
Tony,Joyful,4,2,6,2,"Wow! That's ah, that's pretty nice!"
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,2,6,3,Pretty nice?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,2,6,4,"You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this."
Tony,Neutral,4,2,6,5,"We don't have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We've got a canoe."
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,2,6,7,"Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe."
Tony,Neutral,4,2,6,8,You gotta take the canoe!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,2,6,9,"All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!"
Peter,Sad,4,2,6,10,We're not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,2,6,11,Good for you!!
Rachel Green,Scared,4,2,7,2,"You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar?"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,2,7,3,Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,2,7,4,"You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,2,7,5,"Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!"
Rachel Green,Scared,4,2,7,6,Do we have to tell her?
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,2,7,7,"Yes, we have to tell her!"
Monica Geller,Sad,4,2,7,8,"Oh, but it's made her so happy."
Ross Geller,Scared,4,2,7,9,"Little girl misses her cat. Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her."
#ALL#,Scared,4,2,7,10,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,2,7,11,Thank you.
Rachel Green,Sad,4,2,7,12,I hate when Ross is right!
Monica Geller,Scared,4,2,7,13,"He is right, isn't he?"
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,2,7,14,"Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong."
#ALL#,Scared,4,2,7,15,You think?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,2,7,16,"Oh-no, he's right."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,2,8,2,Hi.
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,2,8,3,Hi!
#ALL#,Neutral,4,2,8,4,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,2,8,5,"Uh, Pheebs, about your mom..."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,2,8,6,Yeah?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,2,8,7,How's that going?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,2,8,8,"So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,2,8,9,That's so sweet. I'm gonna get some coffee.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,2,8,10,Huh? What'd ya say Joe? I'll be right there.
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,2,8,12,Pheebs...
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,2,8,13,"I just feel so, uhh....."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,2,8,14,All right!!
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,2,8,15,I'm coming already!!
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,2,8,16,Jeez!
Monica Geller,Scared,4,2,9,2,Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,2,9,3,"Hello, Chip."
Chip Matthews,Powerful,4,2,9,4,"Hey, Rach! How ya doin'?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,2,9,5,"I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself."
Chip Matthews,Neutral,4,2,9,6,"So ah, Monica ready yet?"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,2,9,7,"She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?"
Chip Matthews,Powerful,4,2,9,8,"Amy Welch? Wow! I haven't seen her since... So, Monica about ready?"
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,2,10,2,"This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man."
Guy,Scared,4,2,10,3,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,2,10,4,"Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin."
Guy,Scared,4,2,10,5,"No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,2,10,6,"Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit."
Guy,Joyful,4,2,10,7,"All right, you have yourself a deal."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,2,10,8,Okay. See?! I told ya!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,2,10,10,"Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!"
Chip Matthews,Neutral,4,2,11,2,"Here, we are."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,2,11,3,Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
Chip Matthews,Scared,4,2,11,4,The what?
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,2,11,5,"That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind."
Chip Matthews,Joyful,4,2,11,6,"No, I think it's cute."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,2,11,7,Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
Chip Matthews,Peaceful,4,2,11,8,So you still in touch with anyone from high school?
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,2,11,9,"Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and umm, I think that's it. How bout you?"
Chip Matthews,Peaceful,4,2,11,10,"Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. I see Spindler a lot. Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,2,11,11,Is that all?
Chip Matthews,Peaceful,4,2,11,12,"Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,2,11,13,"Ohh, how is he?"
Chip Matthews,Scared,4,2,11,14,"Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,2,11,15,Isn't he an architect now?
Chip Matthews,Joyful,4,2,11,16,"Yeah, they still wear underwear."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,2,12,2,OH MY GOD!!!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,2,12,3,WHAT?!!
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,2,12,4,Are you all right?!
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,2,12,5,Yeah...
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,2,12,6,What happened?!!
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,2,12,7,"Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!"
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,2,12,8,What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,2,12,9,"Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!"
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,2,12,10,So-You got in voluntarily?!
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,2,12,11,"I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,2,12,12,BEND OVER?!!!
Chip Matthews,Joyful,4,2,13,2,"...and then Zana, just let one rip!!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,2,13,3,"Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?"
Chip Matthews,Joyful,4,2,13,4,You know where I work!
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,2,13,5,I do?
Chip Matthews,Powerful,4,2,13,6,"The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time."
Monica Geller,Sad,4,2,13,7,You still work at the multiplex?
Chip Matthews,Joyful,4,2,13,8,"Oh, like I'd give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,2,13,9,"Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?"
Chip Matthews,Peaceful,4,2,13,10,"Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,3,1,2,Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,3,1,3,"Oh no-no-no, I'm, I'm paddling away!"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,3,1,4,Huh?!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,3,1,5,Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,3,1,6,"Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,3,1,8,Could we be more white trash?
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,3,2,2,How desperate am I?
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,3,2,3,"Oh! Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game."
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,3,2,4,I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,3,2,5,How come?
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,3,2,6,"Because I need the money, and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect."
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,3,2,7,"Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,3,2,8,You don't have to stick up for her. She can't here you.
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,3,3,2,"Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,3,3,3,Just pickle.
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,3,3,4,"Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,3,3,5,"My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must've been awkward."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,3,3,6,"Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,3,3,7,"You ah, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,3,3,8,No. No!
Joanna,Joyful,4,3,3,9,"Hello, Rachel."
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,3,3,10,"Well, not at first."
Rachel Green,Mad,4,3,3,11,What is she doing here?
Rachel Green,Mad,4,3,3,13,"I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'"
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,3,3,14,"Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level."
Rachel Green,Mad,4,3,3,16,"Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!"
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,3,3,17,"Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself."
Rachel Green,Mad,4,3,3,19,"Chandler!! Promise me, you will end it."
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,3,3,20,"Okay, I promise, I'll end it."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,3,3,21,Thank you.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,3,3,22,"I hope you know what I'm giving up for ya, because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,3,3,23,"Yeah-eh-eah! Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant."
Judy Geller,Neutral,4,3,4,2,How's the hired help?
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,3,4,3,"Doing great, the quiches are coming along."
Judy Geller,Neutral,4,3,4,4,What's this? Blue nail polish?
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,3,4,5,"Yeah, I thought it was cute."
Judy Geller,Powerful,4,3,4,6,"Ahh, that's what your Grandmother's hands looked like when we found her."
Monica Geller,Scared,4,3,4,7,Let me ask you a question.
Judy Geller,Mad,4,3,4,8,Hmm.
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,3,4,9,Why did you hire me?
Judy Geller,Mad,4,3,4,10,"Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren't sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,3,4,11,Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,3,4,12,"Okay, I didn't hear that."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,3,4,13,"Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity, it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I'm good."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,3,4,14,"Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!"
The Salesman,Neutral,4,3,5,2,"Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,3,5,3,Uhhhh.
The Salesman,Powerful,4,3,5,4,"Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?"
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,3,5,5,"No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there."
The Salesman,Sad,4,3,5,6,"Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?"
Ross Geller,Mad,4,3,5,9,...I'm telling you it's totally unconstituional.
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,3,5,13,...I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
#ALL#,Joyful,4,3,5,14,Nooo!!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,3,5,16,...it was like the Algonquin kids table.
The Salesman,Joyful,4,3,5,18,"Excuse me, I'm sorry, you haven't said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,3,5,19,Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
The Salesman,Neutral,4,3,9,2,"So, here's somebody interesting, Joey. What do you know about Van Gogh?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,3,9,3,He cut off his ear.
The Salesman,Neutral,4,3,9,4,And?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,3,9,5,I'm out.
The Salesman,Peaceful,4,3,9,6,He painted that.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,3,9,7,Wow! That's pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear 'cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
The Salesman,Neutral,4,3,9,8,"Let's see, ahhh... Where does the Pope live?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,3,9,9,"In the woods. No wait-wait, that's the joke answer."
The Salesman,Neutral,4,3,9,10,"Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,3,9,11,Spock's birth control.
The Salesman,Sad,4,3,9,12,You need these books.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,3,10,2,Hey!
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,3,10,3,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,3,10,4,This used to be your room? Wow! You must've been in really good shape as a kid.
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,3,10,5,"Ohh, I'm such an idiot. I can't believe I actually thought she could change."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,3,10,6,"Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica."
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,3,10,7,"Oh good, I'm glad that's catching on."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,3,10,8,"No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that pulling a Monica."
Monica Geller,Sad,4,3,10,9,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,3,10,10,"Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, ""Yeah, he pulled a Monica."" Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, ""Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica."" Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, ""Yeah, that one's outta here."" Though some things don't change."
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,3,10,11,"All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,3,10,13,Wow! My breasts are really strong.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,3,11,2,"Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office. Now I know why."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,3,11,3,"Hey, look, you're in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go."
Rachel Green,Scared,4,3,11,4,What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,3,11,5,It still wouldn't be clean. All I want is my freedom.
Rachel Green,Scared,4,3,11,6,Foot rubs for a month!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,3,11,7,Freedom!
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,3,11,8,I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,3,11,9,"Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won't you here me?! Sophie, help me! Help me!!"
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,3,11,10,Sophie sit!!
Rachel Green,Scared,4,3,11,12,"No! God, would you just calm down!"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,3,11,14,I'm gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just...
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,3,12,2,Wow! There's a lot I didn't know about vomit. In a minute.
The Salesman,Peaceful,4,3,12,3,"So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,3,12,4,"Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'."
The Salesman,Scared,4,3,12,5,"Well ah, what can you swing?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,3,12,6,"How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?"
The Salesman,Scared,4,3,12,7,"You don't have, anything?"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,3,12,8,"You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!"
The Salesman,Sad,4,3,12,9,"Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,3,12,10,"And a 50. Huh, these must be Chandler's pants."
The Salesman,Scared,4,3,12,11,"For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A? B? C?"
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,3,12,12,"Oh, I-I think I'm gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,3,13,2,"I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,3,13,3,No!
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,3,13,4,I ah... Oh! I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,3,13,5,With extra pulp?
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,3,13,6,Yeah!!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,3,13,7,No!
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,3,13,8,D'oh!! I've got it!
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,3,13,9,You don't have it.
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,3,13,10,"I have so got it. There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know."
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,3,13,11,How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,3,13,12,"Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous or very stingy."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,3,13,13,Go on.
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,3,13,14,I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,3,13,15,And Milton Berle has a...
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,3,13,16,"Ohh, not compared to you."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,3,14,2,Well?
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,4,3,14,3,They're not even touching the lasagna!
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,3,14,4,Really?!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,3,14,5,"Oh, they love your casserole."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,3,14,6,Yes!!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,3,14,7,It's hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
Judy Geller,Joyful,4,3,14,8,"Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish."
Monica Geller,Scared,4,3,14,9,And you?
Judy Geller,Powerful,4,3,14,10,I thought it was... quite tasty.
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,3,14,11,"So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you..."
Judy Geller,Scared,4,3,14,12,A bitch?
Monica Geller,Scared,4,3,14,13,"Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word."
Judy Geller,Joyful,4,3,14,14,"Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,3,14,15,Wow!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,3,14,16,"Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. She doesn't know we switched it."
Judy Geller,Neutral,4,3,14,17,"And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer."
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,3,14,18,"That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don't bite your nails."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,3,15,2,Hello.
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,3,15,4,"Hello, Chandler."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,3,15,5,I love you.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,3,15,6,Wh-what's going on?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,3,15,7,Oh.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,3,15,9,No he doesn't!
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,3,15,10,"Two hours, that lasted!"
Rachel Green,Sad,4,3,15,11,So did you break up with Joanna?
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,3,15,12,I think so.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,3,15,13,"Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius."
Ross Geller,Scared,4,3,15,14,The volcano?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,3,15,15,"Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,3,15,16,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,3,15,17,"Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant."
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,3,15,18,Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,3,15,19,"Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?"
Monica Geller,Sad,4,3,15,20,Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
#ALL#,Scared,4,3,15,21,"Oh, yeah. Yeah."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,3,15,22,"Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country."
Ross Geller,Scared,4,3,15,23,With such a sad history.
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,3,15,24,Could there be more Kims?
Joanna,Neutral,4,3,16,2,Who's out there?
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,3,16,3,It's me! Good morning!
Joanna,Neutral,4,3,16,4,"Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?"
Rachel Green,Scared,4,3,16,5,"Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn't have poppy seed bagels, so I... Oh my word!"
Joanna,Neutral,4,3,16,6,I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,3,16,7,"Oh, yeah! Yeah!"
Joanna,Powerful,4,3,16,9,You tell your friend Chandler that we're definately broken up this time.
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,3,16,10,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,4,1,2,"Hey! New wallet, huh?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,4,1,3,"Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say 'cool' anymore."
Monica Geller,Mad,4,4,1,4,Rachel!
Rachel Green,Scared,4,4,1,5,What?
Monica Geller,Mad,4,4,1,6,You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,4,1,7,"Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full."
Monica Geller,Mad,4,4,1,8,Have you ever taken out the trash?
Rachel Green,Mad,4,4,1,9,"Well, I thought you liked doing it."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,4,1,10,Third door on the left.

Mr. Treeger,Powerful,4,4,2,5,What are you doing?
Rachel Green,Sad,4,4,2,6,Ummm. Oh! I'm sorry. It's a little old but...
Mr. Treeger,Sad,4,4,2,7,No! You're clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
Rachel Green,Sad,4,4,2,8,I'm sorry. I didn't-I don't come in here a lot.
Mr. Treeger,Neutral,4,4,2,9,"Oh yeah, of course you don't!"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,4,2,10,No.
Mr. Treeger,Powerful,4,4,2,11,"'Cause you're a little princess! ""Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me..."""
Rachel Green,Mad,4,4,2,12,I didn't... I never said that.
Mr. Treeger,Sad,4,4,2,13,"You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?"
Rachel Green,Sad,4,4,2,14,"Okay, I'm sorry."
Monica Geller,Sad,4,4,2,16,God! If you're gonna cry about it!
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,4,3,2,"Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,4,3,3,Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,4,3,4,I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,4,3,5,"Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it."
Rachel Green,Mad,4,4,3,6,"That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,4,3,7,"All right that's it, school is in session!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,4,3,8,My God! Is this a gym card?
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,4,3,9,"Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,4,3,10,So why don't you quit?
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,4,3,11,"You don't think I've tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,4,3,12,Who is Maria?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,4,3,13,"Oh Maria. You can't say no to her, she's like this lycra spandex covered gym...treat."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,4,3,14,You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,4,3,15,No!
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,4,3,16,So you're strong enough to face her on your own?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,4,3,17,"Oh no, you'll have to come."
Mr. Treeger,Neutral,4,4,4,2,"Tribbiani! Hold on, I'll get the plunger."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,4,4,3,"Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord."
Mr. Treeger,Neutral,4,4,4,4,And tell him what?
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,4,4,5,"Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry."
Mr. Treeger,Mad,4,4,4,6,Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,4,4,7,I have actually not heard of that.
Mr. Treeger,Mad,4,4,4,8,"Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I've been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don't need this grief. I'm gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother's apartment. Your friends are outta here pal."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,4,4,9,Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,4,6,2,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,4,6,3,Yes. Yes!
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,4,6,4,"One more time, ""Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"""
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,4,6,5,No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,4,6,6,Good! That's good!

Ross Geller,Neutral,4,4,6,13,Me? No.
Gym Employee,Neutral,4,4,6,14,"Sorry, members only."
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,4,6,15,I wanna quit the gym.
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,4,6,16,"It's okay man, be strong."
Gym Employee,Neutral,4,4,6,17,"So, are you a member of any gym."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,4,6,18,"No! And I'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech."
Gym Employee,Neutral,4,4,6,19,"Okay, no problem. Could you come here for a second?"
Woman,Joyful,4,4,6,21,"Hi, I'm Maria."
Rick Sanoven,Joyful,4,4,7,2,"Wow, you have really pretty feet."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,4,7,3,These old things.
Rick Sanoven,Neutral,4,4,7,4,"Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it's been killing me today."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,4,7,5,"You mean the-Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion."
Rick Sanoven,Neutral,4,4,7,6,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,4,7,7,"Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y'know, real nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area."
Rick Sanoven,Neutral,4,4,7,8,"Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,4,7,9,Oh.
Rick Sanoven,Scared,4,4,7,10,Ow! Did you just bite me?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,4,7,11,No!
Mr. Treeger,Neutral,4,4,8,2,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,4,8,3,"Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn't there fault, it was mine."
Mr. Treeger,Powerful,4,4,8,4,You want me to kick you guys out instead?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,4,8,5,"No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?"
Mr. Treeger,Mad,4,4,8,6,You have pets!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,4,8,7,"Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck."
Mr. Treeger,Neutral,4,4,8,8,"Huh, I would've thought it was the other way around."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,4,8,9,"Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want."

Mr. Treeger,Sad,4,4,10,7,Ahhhh! I'm sorry!
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,4,10,8,"No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge, my breasts are coming out my back."
Mr. Treeger,Sad,4,4,10,9,"Ahh, forget it! I'll never be any good at this, my mom was right, I'm just a big potato with arms, and legs, and a head."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,4,10,10,"Come on man, you're not a potato."

Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,5,9,15,"Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?"

Monica Geller,Neutral,4,5,10,8,Why?
Rachel Green,Mad,4,5,10,9,Because he's stealing from me!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,5,10,10,"Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket."
Rachel Green,Mad,4,5,10,11,Ughh!
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,5,10,12,"Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,5,10,13,Thank you so much Phoebe.

Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,5,11,5,"Ohh, she's-she's not really my type."
Kathy,Peaceful,4,5,11,6,Not your type?! She's gorgeous!
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,5,11,7,Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
Kathy,Joyful,4,5,11,8,"Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,5,11,9,"Uhh, no-no thanks."
Kathy,Joyful,4,5,11,10,"Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,5,11,11,"Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,5,11,12,I'll be right back. What was that?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,5,11,13,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,5,11,14,Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,5,11,15,"Hey, look, what do you want from me?"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,5,11,16,"I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,5,11,17,I am pretending.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,5,11,18,"Well then, do it better!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,5,11,19,"Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,5,11,20,"Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,5,12,2,"Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?"
Monica Geller,Scared,4,5,12,3,"No, sorry."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,5,12,4,Well where's Amanda?
Monica Geller,Sad,4,5,12,5,"Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,5,12,6,"I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out."
Monica Geller,Sad,4,5,12,7,"Ross, cough drops, please?"
Ross Geller,Mad,4,5,12,8,At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
Rachel Green,Mad,4,5,12,9,"Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,5,12,10,You see Amanda and I have a very special...
Monica Geller,Mad,4,5,12,11,You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,5,12,12,"Ohh, that is soo sad."
Monica Geller,Mad,4,5,12,13,"And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'"
Rachel Green,Mad,4,5,12,15,"Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!"
Monica Geller,Mad,4,5,12,16,"That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!"
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,5,12,17,Fine.
Rachel Green,Scared,4,5,12,18,Sorry.
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,5,12,19,Here. At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,5,12,20,Y'know...
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,5,16,2,And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.
Gunther,Scared,4,5,16,4,Rachel?
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,5,16,5,Yeah.
Gunther,Neutral,4,5,16,6,I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day_
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,5,16,7,No!
Gunther,Scared,4,5,16,8,"Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't stop it, and I've been feeling guilty."
Rachel Green,Scared,4,5,16,9,Okay.
Gunther,Powerful,4,5,16,10,"So umm, are we cool?"
Rachel Green,Scared,4,5,16,11,Okay.
Gunther,Mad,4,5,16,12,I knew you'd understand.
Cheryl,Joyful,4,6,1,2,"So, thank you for the delicious dinner."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,6,1,3,You're welcome for a delicious dinner.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,6,1,5,Hey what are you guys looking at?
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,6,1,6,Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,6,1,7,"Yeah, come to papa."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,6,1,9,I know!
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,6,1,10,"Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,6,1,11,"Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,6,1,12,"Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?"
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,6,1,13,"Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,6,1,14,"Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,6,1,15,"I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,6,1,16,Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,6,1,17,Fine by me; hope she wins.
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,6,3,2,Huh...
Cheryl,Peaceful,4,6,3,3,"Um, would you like to come in?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,6,3,4,Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?
Cheryl,Neutral,4,6,3,5,According to recent findings!
Cheryl,Scared,4,6,3,7,Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!
Ross Geller,Scared,4,6,3,8,Mitzi is.....
Cheryl,Peaceful,4,6,3,9,"My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat."
Ross Geller,Scared,4,6,3,10,"Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?"
Cheryl,Scared,4,6,3,11,What?
Ross Geller,Scared,4,6,3,12,"Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh..."
Cheryl,Peaceful,4,6,3,13,I'd rather not.
Ross Geller,Scared,4,6,3,14,"Oh, yeah, why not?"
Cheryl,Neutral,4,6,3,15,"Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,6,4,2,"Oh, is everything in the car?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,6,4,3,Yes. Did you settle the bill?
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,6,4,4,No. I hate this part.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,6,4,5,"Oh, look what we almost left."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,6,4,6,"No, that's not mine."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,6,4,7,"Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!"
Monica Geller,Mad,4,6,4,9,"Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen."
Mrs. Burkart,Joyful,4,6,4,10,"Oh, good. Thank you."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,6,4,11,"Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of..."
Mrs. Burkart,Joyful,4,6,4,12,Dear?
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,6,4,13,Just the matter of ...payment?
Mrs. Burkart,Sad,4,6,4,14,Jack used to handle the finances!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,6,6,2,"But Mon, you have to get our money!"
Monica Geller,Sad,4,6,6,3,"Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,6,6,4,"I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,6,6,5,What?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,6,6,6,"Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, ""that massage wasn't long enough, or, ""I don't recognize any of those songs,"" or, you know, ""these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"""
Monica Geller,Sad,4,6,6,7,Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,6,6,8,"Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill."
Monica Geller,Sad,4,6,6,9,"Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me."
Mrs. Burkart,Joyful,4,6,6,11,"You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave...."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,6,6,12,She seems fine now.
Mrs. Burkart,Joyful,4,6,6,13,...emblem of the land I love. The home of....
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,6,7,2,"So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?"
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,6,7,3,You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,6,7,4,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,6,7,5,"Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,6,7,6,"Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?"
Ross Geller,Scared,4,6,7,7,What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,6,7,8,"All right, so... next time, you take her to your place."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,6,7,9,"No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,6,7,10,What kind of smell?
Ross Geller,Scared,4,6,7,11,I don't know. Soap?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,6,7,12,"All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,6,7,13,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,6,7,14,"You wanna see her again, right?"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,6,7,15,Yeah.
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,6,7,16,So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,6,7,17,"Yeah, okay you're right."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,6,7,18,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Sad,4,6,7,19,"I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?"
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,6,7,20,Yeah!
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,6,7,21,"It's, uh... it's endearing, really."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,6,7,22,All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,6,8,2,"Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,6,8,3,Any luck?
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,6,8,4,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called ""Invisible things for Kathy."" Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?"
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,6,8,5,"All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,6,8,6,"She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,6,8,7,"Aw, honey, that's so sweet."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,6,8,8,Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,6,8,9,Oh! Pathetic!
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,6,8,10,Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,6,8,11,Where?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,6,8,12,"Our place, the hall! I..."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,6,8,13,I got something for her. It's a book!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,6,8,14,A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,6,8,15,"No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?"
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,6,8,16,"You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,6,8,17,"No, it came out to an even twenty."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,6,8,18,Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
Mrs. Burkart,Joyful,4,6,9,2,"Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes?"
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,6,9,4,"You didn't get the money, did you?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,6,9,5,"Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!"
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,6,9,6,"No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! Hey, widow?"
Mrs. Burkart,Scared,4,6,9,7,Come on along and listen to...
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,6,9,8,"Okay, Widow!"
Mrs. Burkart,Sad,4,6,9,9,...the lullabye of...
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,6,9,10,"Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go."
Mrs. Burkart,Mad,4,6,9,11,All right. I'll get my bag.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,6,9,12,Good.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,6,9,13,I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.
Cheryl,Neutral,4,6,10,2,So you want to come inside?
Ross Geller,Scared,4,6,10,3,Yes. Yes I do.
Cheryl,Neutral,4,6,10,4,I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable.
Cheryl,Joyful,4,6,10,5,Guess who?
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,6,10,6,Department of Sanitation?
Cheryl,Joyful,4,6,10,7,It's me!
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,6,10,8,Oh! Ah. Aw!
Cheryl,Neutral,4,6,10,9,What?
Ross Geller,Scared,4,6,10,10,"Ah, Cheryl!"
Cheryl,Joyful,4,6,10,11,"Oh, Ross!"
Cheryl,Scared,4,6,10,13,Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!
Ross Geller,Scared,4,6,10,14,"Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out."
Cheryl,Peaceful,4,6,10,15,"Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,6,11,2,I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!
Gunther,Powerful,4,6,11,4,Move!
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,6,11,6,"Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,6,11,8,Uh... yay!
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,6,11,9,Thanks!
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,6,11,10,"Oh, that's great! Congratulations!"
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,6,11,11,"Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,6,11,12,"Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,4,6,11,13,Yeah. I'm a hard ass.
Monica Geller,Mad,4,6,11,14,And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,6,11,15,Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,6,11,16,"Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,6,11,17,Okay!
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,6,11,18,I can cook and you can take care of the money.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,6,11,19,Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!
Both,Joyful,4,6,11,20,Aah!
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,7,1,2,I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,7,1,3,"Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise."
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,7,1,4,"It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommates girlfriend-which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she's smooth! Smooth!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,7,1,6,Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
#ALL#,Joyful,4,7,1,7,Yeah! Oh my God!
Casey,Neutral,4,7,2,2,Here you go.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,7,2,3,"Great! All right, so I'll call you later."
Casey,Joyful,4,7,2,4,Great!
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,7,2,5,Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,7,2,6,That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,7,2,7,"Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,7,2,8,"No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey."
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,7,2,9,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,7,2,10,Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,7,2,11,Wait! You're going out with Kathy!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,7,2,12,Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,7,2,13,"Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,7,2,14,What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,7,2,15,"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,7,2,16,You got all that from the back of her head?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,7,2,17,"All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,7,2,18,Who's Elaine?
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,7,5,2,"No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!"
Kathy,Scared,4,7,5,3,Horrible!
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,7,5,4,"Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?"
Kathy,Peaceful,4,7,5,5,"No-no-no, the kiss was good."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,7,5,6,Okay!
Kathy,Sad,4,7,5,7,"No, but that's bad!"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,7,5,8,"Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do, we-we forget it happened."
Kathy,Neutral,4,7,5,9,What?!
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,7,5,10,"Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?"
Kathy,Scared,4,7,5,11,Can you really do that?
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,7,5,12,"I have to; he's my best friend, and you're seeing him."
Kathy,Sad,4,7,5,13,"Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you..."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,7,5,14,"Oh-no-no-no! Don't! Don't! See-see, you're getting me confused, I'm starting to urn."
Kathy,Neutral,4,7,5,15,"I'm sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try."
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,7,5,16,I-I think we have too.
Kathy,Peaceful,4,7,5,17,Okay. Bye.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,7,5,18,Bye. Are you still out there?
Kathy,Scared,4,7,5,19,No.
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,7,6,2,Electrifying. Emphatic time-time-time...
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,7,6,3,"Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,7,6,4,It's so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,7,6,6,Thank you guys-guys-guys...
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,7,6,7,"Hey, aren't you up next?"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,4,7,6,8,"Oh no, I'm not playing tonight."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,7,6,9,Why not?
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,4,7,6,10,I can't follow Ross! It'd be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,7,6,11,"Phoebe, Ross sucks!"
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,7,6,12,"Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,7,6,13,"Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!"
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,7,6,15,"Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,7,6,16,"Yeah, Phoebe you're... awful!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,7,6,17,You guys. You suck too.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,7,7,2,Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,7,7,3,Hang on buddy!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,7,7,4,Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,7,7,5,I sure did.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,7,7,6,Why?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,7,7,7,"Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,7,7,8,"Well, you're amazing."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,7,7,9,Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,7,7,10,"A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,7,7,11,"Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,7,7,12,"Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,7,7,13,"Oh, I don't know."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,7,7,14,"Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,7,7,15,You mean with Casey.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,7,7,16,"No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,7,7,17,Or Casey.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,7,7,18,"No-no, Kathy."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,7,7,19,Could be Casey.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,7,7,20,"No. No, Kathy."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,7,7,21,Consider Casey.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,7,7,22,Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,7,7,23,That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,7,8,2,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,7,8,3,"Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!"
Ross Geller,Scared,4,7,8,4,"Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,7,8,5,"Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,7,8,6,Pheebs...
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,7,8,7,"Yeah, I-I can't-I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just-I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I..."
Ross Geller,Sad,4,7,8,8,"See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I... I won't play anymore."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,4,7,8,9,"Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,7,8,10,"Yeah, okay."
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,7,9,2,Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,7,9,3,Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,7,9,4,I kissed Kathy.
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,7,9,5,What?
Monica Geller,Scared,4,7,9,6,Are you serious?
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,7,9,7,Does Joey know?
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,7,9,8,"No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,7,9,9,You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends. Which we all appreciate.
Ross Geller,Sad,4,7,9,10,"No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside."
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,7,9,11,"Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,4,7,9,12,"I think maybe, yeah."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,7,9,13,He loves you.
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,7,9,14,Then why didn't you tell me to do that?!!
Ross Geller,Sad,4,7,9,15,"Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,7,9,16,"Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,7,9,17,"I know, I remember that!"
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,7,9,18,I remember you did.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,7,9,19,God!! What am I gonna do?!
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,7,9,20,"Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,7,9,21,Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,7,9,22,Because you do.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,7,9,23,"Yeah, I know."
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,7,9,24,"Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,7,11,2,"Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,7,11,3,What?
Rachel Green,Mad,4,7,11,4,"Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves."
Ross Geller,Scared,4,7,11,6,"Thank you, thanks. Yeah, I lost it. Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, would you, can you finish my set?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,7,11,7,"After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,7,11,9,"Yeah, like I could lose it."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,7,11,10,What?
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,7,11,11,I played bad on purpose guys.
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,7,11,13,"Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,7,11,14,"Yeah-no, just that last song."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,8,1,2,Hello.
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,8,1,3,"Hey, it's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me, so I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone. All I..."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,8,1,6,Hello.
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,8,1,7,"Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I'm..."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,8,1,10,Stop callin'!!
Voice,Neutral,4,8,1,11,"Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,8,1,12,All right!
Voice,Mad,4,8,1,13,"What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything..."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,8,3,2,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,8,3,3,Hey!
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,8,3,4,What are you doing?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,8,3,5,I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,8,3,6,Everything? Even the TV?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,8,3,7,No! I'm putting that in my room.
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,8,3,8,"Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,8,3,9,"Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,8,3,10,"That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,8,3,11,Five years.
Ross Geller,Scared,4,8,3,12,You've sentenced him?!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,8,3,13,Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,8,3,14,"Joey, the guy's your best friend."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,8,3,15,"No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open."
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,8,3,16,"Oh, who? Me?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,8,3,17,Yeah!
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,8,3,18,Wow! I'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,8,3,19,What?
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,8,3,20,I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,8,3,21,All right. But if you weren't my best friend.
Kathy,Powerful,4,8,4,2,"Oh my God, is it really that bad?"
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,8,4,3,"I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,8,4,4,"Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?"
Gunther,Neutral,4,8,4,5,"I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there."
Kathy,Neutral,4,8,4,7,Oh.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,8,4,8,Hey Joe.
Doctor,Powerful,4,8,5,2,"I'll be right with you. Okay? Thanks, Wendy."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,8,5,3,Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,8,5,4,"Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye."
Nurse,Peaceful,4,8,5,6,Dr. Burke will see you know.
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,8,5,7,"Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now."
Nurse,Powerful,4,8,5,8,"Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now."
Timothy Burke,Powerful,4,8,5,9,Ready?
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,8,6,2,Hey! I'm sorry! That- where are you going?
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,8,6,3,My folks.
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,8,6,4,"Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?"
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,8,6,5,I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,8,6,6,What?!
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,8,6,7,"Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I..."
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,8,6,8,"Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?"
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,8,6,9,"Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya."
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,8,6,10,"Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,8,6,11,Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,8,6,13,"All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,8,6,14,"When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!"
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,8,6,15,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,8,6,16,"Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!"
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,8,6,17,"All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?"
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,8,6,18,We've got a box.
Timothy Burke,Neutral,4,8,7,2,"Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,8,7,3,I was probably waiting for it to open.
Timothy Burke,Joyful,4,8,7,4,"I gotta tell you, you look great now."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,8,7,5,You look great too.
Timothy Burke,Joyful,4,8,7,6,You're an excellent patient!
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,8,7,7,So how does it look?
Timothy Burke,Neutral,4,8,7,8,"Well, you've got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days."
Monica Geller,Scared,4,8,7,9,Like a pirate?!
Timothy Burke,Neutral,4,8,7,10,If that helps you.
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,8,7,11,"Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him."
Timothy Burke,Neutral,4,8,7,12,I moved back here a couple of months ago.
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,8,7,13,Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
Timothy Burke,Neutral,4,8,7,14,Uh.
Monica Geller,Scared,4,8,7,15,No way!
Timothy Burke,Neutral,4,8,7,16,I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.
Monica Geller,Sad,4,8,7,17,Oh.
Timothy Burke,Neutral,4,8,7,18,But we broke up.
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,8,7,19,Oh.
Timothy Burke,Sad,4,8,7,20,She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,8,7,21,"Oh. So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?"
Timothy Burke,Neutral,4,8,7,22,You're not wearing the patch yet.
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,8,7,23,I know.
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,8,9,2,"Oh, he sees her!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,8,9,3,"Oh, he's catching up to her!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,8,9,4,"Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging!"
Ross Geller,Scared,4,8,9,5,He's taking her purse!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,8,9,6,"Uhh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,8,9,7,"Oh, there they are!"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,8,9,9,"All right, get a room."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,9,1,2,Okay!
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,9,1,3,"Come on, no peeking!"
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,9,1,4,Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,9,1,5,"Okayyyyy, open up!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,9,1,7,What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,9,1,8,"Yeah, it's for our catering business!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,9,1,9,I think I know that girl.
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,9,1,10,"All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,9,1,11,No?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,9,1,12,"No, we're gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette."
Rachel Green,Sad,4,9,1,13,Oh!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,9,1,14,"And also, we don't know what to do with this."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,9,1,15,"Oh yeah, I definitely know her."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,9,3,2,"Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss..."
Joanna,Powerful,4,9,3,3,"Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,9,3,4,"Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and..."
Joanna,Powerful,4,9,3,5,"Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,9,3,6,"God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying."
Joanna,Scared,4,9,3,7,"Really? Well, in that case..."
Rachel Green,Scared,4,9,3,8,And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.
Joanna,Joyful,4,9,3,9,"That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,9,3,10,Ohh! That's great!
Joanna,Powerful,4,9,3,11,"You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job."
Rachel Green,Scared,4,9,3,12,Really?!
Joanna,Sad,4,9,3,13,"No-ho-ho! Yeah. I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,9,3,14,"Well, I, umm..."
Joanna,Joyful,4,9,3,15,"Kidding! God, I feel wild today!"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,9,4,2,Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,9,4,3,"Will you calm down, he's just a human guy."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,9,4,4,"Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,9,4,5,Really?!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,9,4,6,"Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there."
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,9,4,7,"Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,9,4,8,It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,9,4,9,"All right, I'll see you guys."
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,9,4,11,Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,9,4,12,"I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,9,4,13,Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,9,4,14,Okay.
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,9,4,15,"Hello. It's Gandolf!!! So, are you in town? Oh, well, well maybe next time then."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,9,4,16,What happened?
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,9,4,17,"He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago."
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,9,4,18,"Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!"
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,9,4,19,"Stupid, useless Canadian money!"
Mr. Posner,Powerful,4,9,5,2,"You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,9,5,3,Thank you.
Joanna,Joyful,4,9,5,4,Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
Rachel Green,Mad,4,9,5,5,"Well, they uh, they-they do more than that."
Mrs. Lynch,Powerful,4,9,5,6,I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,9,5,7,"Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me."
Joanna,Joyful,4,9,5,8,Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time!
Rachel Green,Mad,4,9,5,9,"I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that."
Joanna,Scared,4,9,5,10,"Oh yes, well there's the coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once!"
Mr. Posner,Powerful,4,9,5,11,"Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,9,5,12,"Yes, I realize that..."
Joanna,Neutral,4,9,5,13,"And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,9,5,14,I love working with designers!
Joanna,Scared,4,9,5,15,"With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?"
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,9,6,2,Hey! My first review is out!
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,9,6,3,"Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,9,6,4,"All right, look at my on the back page."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,9,6,5,"Oh, okay! ""Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head."" Wow! You really laid into this place."
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,9,6,6,"Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,9,6,7,"Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,9,6,8,Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,4,9,6,9,"No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,9,6,10,Haven't we made this decision?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,9,6,11,"Yeah, all right."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,9,6,12,Bye!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,9,6,13,Bye!
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,9,6,15,Who is it?
Allesandro,Neutral,4,9,6,16,"It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,9,6,17,Oh my God.
Allesandro,Powerful,4,9,6,18,I want to talk to you about your review.
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,9,6,19,"Oh my God, oh my God. Call me on the phone!"
Allesandro,Powerful,4,9,6,20,Why? So you could hang up on me?
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,9,6,21,"Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away."
Allesandro,Powerful,4,9,6,22,Just give me a chance too...
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,9,6,23,"Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,9,6,24,No! Phoebe!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,9,6,25,"Hey, Monica!"
Allesandro,Mad,4,9,7,2,I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!
Monica Geller,Mad,4,9,7,3,"I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books."
Allesandro,Mad,4,9,7,4,Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
Monica Geller,Mad,4,9,7,5,The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
Allesandro,Mad,4,9,7,6,"Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!"
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,9,7,7,"All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery."
Allesandro,Powerful,4,9,7,8,"Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious."
Monica Geller,Mad,4,9,7,9,Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Allesandro,Scared,4,9,7,10,Lebanon.
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,9,7,11,"Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them."
Allesandro,Mad,4,9,7,12,How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,9,9,2,Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,9,9,3,"It's Gandolf, and he's not coming."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,9,9,4,So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,9,9,5,No! I balanced my checkbook.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,9,9,6,"Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players."
Ross Geller,Scared,4,9,9,7,I can't believe he didn't come!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,9,9,8,So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,9,9,9,"Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!"
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,9,9,10,"Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!"
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,9,9,11,"Well, we could do that!"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,9,9,12,There's other stuff too.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,9,9,13,"We'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!"
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,9,9,14,Yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,9,9,15,Yeah!
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,9,9,16,Yeah!!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,9,9,17,Yeah!!
Ross Geller,Mad,4,9,9,18,It's not like we don't know how to party!!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,9,9,19,Yeah! All right? Let's go!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,9,9,20,And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,9,9,22,All right!!
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,9,9,23,"Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,9,9,24,"Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?"
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,9,9,25,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,9,9,26,"Well, those were seals, man."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,9,11,2,"All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,9,11,3,"Yeah, all right."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,9,11,4,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,9,11,5,"So, we're having fun, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,9,11,7,"We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,9,11,8,I'm kinda beat.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,9,11,9,"Actually, me too."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,9,11,10,Are you serious?!
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,9,11,12,Thank God! I'm exhausted!
Gunther,Scared,4,9,11,13,So you guys want coffees?
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,9,11,14,"Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,9,11,15,"Yeah, me too."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,9,11,16,"Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,9,11,17,"I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad."
Ross Geller,Sad,4,9,11,18,"I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,9,11,20,How sad are we?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,9,11,21,"Yeah, I know."
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,9,11,22,"Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,9,11,24,Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,9,11,26,"And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,9,11,27,"We're 29, we're not women."
Monica Geller,Scared,4,9,12,2,"Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,9,12,3,"Okay, I'm hearing."
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,9,12,4,"I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,9,12,5,What?!
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,9,12,6,Or! A bakery delivery person.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,9,12,7,I wa-I wa-I wa...
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,9,12,8,Pizza?!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,9,12,9,Monica!
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,9,12,10,"All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,9,12,11,No.
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,9,12,12,"Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,9,12,13,No.
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,9,12,14,"Y'know what, let's do the catering business."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,9,12,15,Really?! Are you sure?
Monica Geller,Scared,4,9,12,16,"Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,9,12,17,"Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job."
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,9,12,18,Really?!
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,9,12,19,"Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,9,12,20,Thank you.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,9,12,21,"Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,9,13,2,"Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?"
Mrs. Lynch,Joyful,4,9,13,3,Oh my goodness! You haven't heard!
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,9,13,4,Heard what?
Mrs. Lynch,Sad,4,9,13,5,Joanna passed away last night.
Rachel Green,Sad,4,9,13,6,Oh my God! How?!
Mrs. Lynch,Scared,4,9,13,7,"Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab."
Rachel Green,Sad,4,9,13,8,"Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!"
Mrs. Lynch,Powerful,4,9,13,9,I know!
Rachel Green,Sad,4,9,13,10,"Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God."
Mrs. Lynch,Sad,4,9,13,11,I didn't realize that she was so close.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,9,13,12,"Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened."
Mrs. Lynch,Sad,4,9,13,13,"No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later."
Rachel Green,Sad,4,9,13,14,"Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?"
Mrs. Lynch,Sad,4,9,13,15,"No, I'm sorry. I have to go."
Sophie,Joyful,4,9,13,16,Good morning!
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,9,13,17,"Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna..."
Sophie,Joyful,4,9,13,18,I sure did!
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,10,1,2,Hey!
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,10,1,4,"I'm sorry I'm late, did I miss anything?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,10,1,5,Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,10,1,6,15? Your personal best!
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,10,1,7,Where were you?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,10,1,8,"Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,10,1,10,"Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?"
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,10,1,11,"Oh, which museum?"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,10,1,12,"No, answer his."
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,10,1,13,"Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,10,1,14,Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,10,1,15,"No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,10,1,16,How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,10,1,17,"Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?"
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,10,3,2,"I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me, I'm... I mean... No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out. I'm not-I'm not-I'm not gay!"
Drew,Peaceful,4,10,3,3,I didn't think you were gay. I do now.
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,10,3,4,"See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up."
Drew,Scared,4,10,3,5,"Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I'm not looking for any thing serious."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,10,3,6,"Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel."
Mike,Joyful,4,10,3,7,"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,10,3,8,"Oh, by the way, that is her full name."
Mike,Joyful,4,10,3,9,Oh wow! I'm free for her!
Drew,Neutral,4,10,3,10,"Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free!"
Mike,Neutral,4,10,3,11,"Hey, Chandler, why don't we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?"
Drew,Powerful,4,10,3,12,"Hold on, y'know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,10,3,13,"Oh well, that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!"
Mike,Joyful,4,10,3,14,"Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,10,3,15,"Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,10,5,2,"Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight."
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,10,5,3,Oh yeah! With who?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,10,5,4,You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,10,5,5,Yeah.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,10,5,6,"Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can't decide between the two of them. Y'know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty, I guess she's smart, she's not fun."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,10,5,7,"If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,10,5,8,"Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,10,5,9,Hey!
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,10,5,10,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,10,5,11,"Hey, man!"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,10,5,12,"Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?"
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,10,5,13,Damn!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,10,6,2,Hey.
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,10,6,3,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,10,6,4,"Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?"
Monica Geller,Mad,4,10,6,5,"They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,10,6,6,You got it! Oh-oh!
Monica Geller,Mad,4,10,6,7,What are you doing?!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,10,6,8,It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,10,6,9,Thanks. I think you got it!
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,10,7,2,Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,10,7,3,"Well, like father, like son."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,10,7,4,Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,10,7,5,Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Rachel Green,Scared,4,10,7,6,"Well, y'know, possibly. You didn't tell him that, though? Right?"
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,10,7,7,"Ummmmmmmm, no."
Rachel Green,Mad,4,10,7,8,You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don't tell the guy that!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,10,7,9,Why not?! I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get-oh I see.
Rachel Green,Mad,4,10,7,10,"Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date-oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,10,8,2,"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,10,8,3,"Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname."
A Waiter,Peaceful,4,10,8,4,"Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,10,8,5,There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
The Waiter,Scared,4,10,8,6,"Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers."
Monica Geller,Mad,4,10,8,7,"Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?"
The Waiter,Neutral,4,10,8,8,Because we can remember them.
Monica Geller,Mad,4,10,8,9,Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
The Waiter,Powerful,4,10,8,10,"Well, sure, that too."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,10,8,11,"Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere..."
The Waiter,Powerful,4,10,8,12,Can't hear you!
Monica Geller,Mad,4,10,8,13,"A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,10,8,14,No ma'am.
The Waiter,Neutral,4,10,8,15,"Hey! He has a name, it's Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. We did the hat right?"
Monica Geller,Scared,4,10,9,2,What the hell happened?!
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,10,9,3,"I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, ""Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!"""
Monica Geller,Mad,4,10,9,4,"Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,10,9,5,"And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,10,9,6,What kinda things have you been saying?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,10,9,7,"Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,10,10,2,"Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry..."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,10,10,3,"Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,10,10,4,What?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,10,10,5,"I'm not Jewish, so..."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,10,10,6,"So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss, but you don't hear him complaining do you? God!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,10,10,7,Bad dream?
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,10,10,8,I wasn't sleeping.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,10,10,9,"Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,10,10,10,"The one with the cat. I gotta go, I've got another date."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,10,10,11,"So, did you pick one yet?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,10,10,12,"No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought-it wasn't that funny. So I'm still torn."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,10,10,13,"Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!"
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,10,10,14,"Y'know, you're right. Thank you."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,10,10,15,"Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,10,10,16,Prague?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,10,10,17,There's sooo much you don't know.
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,10,11,2,"Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?"
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,10,11,3,I did! I absolutely did!
Rachel Green,Mad,4,10,11,4,You idiot!!
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,10,11,5,"I'm sure you're right, but why?"
Rachel Green,Mad,4,10,11,6,You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,10,11,7,"Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry."
Rachel Green,Mad,4,10,11,8,"Y'know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!"
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,10,11,9,I know! I know!
Rachel Green,Mad,4,10,11,10,"Oh! See just I'm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!"
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,10,11,11,"Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody! You're a great catch! Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,10,11,12,Really?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,10,11,13,"Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,10,11,14,No.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,10,11,15,"Oh, it doesn't matter. Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,10,11,16,Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,10,11,17,"Well, actually it's a hockey team, so it's angry Canadians with no teeth."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,10,11,18,Well that sounds fun too.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,10,11,20,Have you ever been with a woman?
Rachel Green,Mad,4,10,11,21,"What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!"
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,10,11,22,So there is no good time to ask that question.
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,10,13,2,I need more swordfish. Can you get me some more swordfish?
Kitchen Worker,Mad,4,10,13,3,I don't speak English.
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,10,13,4,You did a minute ago!
Kitchen Worker,Mad,4,10,13,5,"Well, I don't know what to tell ya!"
Monica Geller,Mad,4,10,13,6,Fine!
Monica Geller,Mad,4,10,13,8,"Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I'm cold! And covered in marinara sauce! Come on! Let me out!"
The Waiter,Powerful,4,10,13,9,"You found that handle, did ya?"
Monica Geller,Mad,4,10,13,10,That's not funny.
The Waiter,Powerful,4,10,13,11,Well that's not true.
Monica Geller,Scared,4,10,13,12,"I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is..."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,10,13,13,Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
Monica Geller,Mad,4,10,13,14,You do?
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,10,13,15,"You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all."
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,10,13,16,Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,10,13,17,What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
Monica Geller,Mad,4,10,13,18,You bet your ass I'm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! All right! Anybody else got a problem? How 'bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?
The Waiter,Scared,4,10,13,19,No.
Monica Geller,Mad,4,10,13,20,How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it's funny now?
The Waiter,Joyful,4,10,13,21,"No, it's really good."
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,10,13,22,"Good! Now, take those salads to table 4, And you! Get the swordfish! And you! Get a haircut!"
The Conductor,Neutral,4,10,14,2,"Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,10,14,3,What?
Woman On Train,Joyful,4,10,14,4,"I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,10,14,5,What?
Woman On Train,Joyful,4,10,14,6,We're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,10,14,7,Are we really in Montreal?!
Woman On Train,Joyful,4,10,14,8,"Yes we are. So, coffee?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,10,14,9,"Coffee sounds great. Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?"
Woman On Train,Neutral,4,10,14,10,"Oh, no. But it's just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,10,15,2,Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,10,15,3,Thanks.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,10,15,4,Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
Monica Geller,Mad,4,10,15,5,Enough!
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,10,15,6,Lean-lean-lean!
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,11,1,2,Oh my God! I can't believe my little brother is married!
Frank Buffay Jr.,Joyful,4,11,1,3,Oh I know!!
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,11,1,4,"You guys, why didn't you tell me you were eloping?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,Sad,4,11,1,5,"'Cause it just sorta happened, y'know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch..."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,11,1,6,"Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,Joyful,4,11,1,7,"We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like, ""Hey! Y'know, we're here, having lunch let's get married!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,11,1,8,"Wow, a year and a half ago I didn't even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too. Okay. Okay. Stop it, don't. So, I gotta get you a gift now. Is there anything you need?"
Frank Buffay Jr.,Neutral,4,11,1,9,"Uhh, yeah."
Alice Knight,Joyful,4,11,1,10,"We've been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we thought we'd get a jump on things, y'know no one's getting any younger."
Frank Buffay Jr.,Neutral,4,11,1,11,"See the thing is umm, we're not able to y'know, uh, conceive."
Alice Knight,Neutral,4,11,1,12,"And we've tried everything, we've seen a bunch of doctors."
Frank Buffay Jr.,Powerful,4,11,1,13,"Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,11,1,14,That's a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.
Phoebe Abbott,Peaceful,4,11,5,2,It's open! Come in!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,11,5,3,Hi!
Phoebe Abbott,Joyful,4,11,5,4,Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,11,5,5,"I'm sorry, I'm late."
Phoebe Abbott,Joyful,4,11,5,6,"Oh, that's okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,11,5,7,Wow! You really go all out when you're expecting company.
Phoebe Abbott,Joyful,4,11,5,8,"No, I was working on my pottery."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,11,5,9,"Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didn't know that you did...pot."
Phoebe Abbott,Powerful,4,11,5,10,"Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,11,5,11,"Ooh, erotiery!"
Phoebe Abbott,Scared,4,11,5,12,Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. Y'know...
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,11,5,13,Okay.
Phoebe Abbott,Scared,4,11,5,14,"I really don't think it's a very good idea, Phoebe."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,11,5,15,Why not?
Phoebe Abbott,Scared,4,11,5,16,"Well, because you'd be giving up a baby, and I-I really don't-I don't know if there's anything I can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm,"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,11,5,17,Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
Phoebe Abbott,Scared,4,11,5,18,"No-no-no, the-the puppy's yours."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,11,5,19,"Oh, I get a puppy!!"
Phoebe Abbott,Joyful,4,11,5,20,"Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,11,5,21,Why?
Phoebe Abbott,Joyful,4,11,5,22,"I realise I don't have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm, uhh... Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,11,5,23,Okay.
Phoebe Abbott,Powerful,4,11,5,24,"I mean, I know what I'm talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,4,11,5,25,"All right, I'm sorry."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,11,6,2,"Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm-I'm saving this for my friend Ross."
Tour Guide,Neutral,4,11,6,3,You mean Dr. Geller?
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,11,6,4,Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.
Tour Guide,Peaceful,4,11,6,5,"Oh, he won't sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there, and only the people in the blue blazers sit here."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,11,6,6,"Well, how-how come?"
Tour Guide,Joyful,4,11,6,7,That's just the way it is.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,11,6,8,That's crazy.
Tour Guide,Joyful,4,11,6,9,"Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now... Peter! Hey, Peter! It's me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddin' which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! See, he pretend he don't even here me!"
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,11,6,10,"I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you. Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it! Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,11,6,11,"That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey."
Tour Guide,Joyful,4,11,6,13,"Op, this is saved. Gift shop."
Ross Geller,Sad,4,11,7,2,"Hey, uh, I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,11,7,3,"It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,11,7,4,"But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,11,7,5,Whatever.
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,11,7,6,"It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?"
Monica Geller,Sad,4,11,7,7,I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,11,7,8,"Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal. Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it. Y'know, hey I understand. Y'know? Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow."
Rachel Green,Sad,4,11,7,9,"Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave."
Older Scientist,Scared,4,11,9,2,"Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here."
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,11,9,3,"Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but I'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. I'm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if he'll sit with me."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,11,9,4,I will sit with you Dr. Geller.
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,11,9,5,"Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, ""My God why?!"" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. I'm Ross! I'm divorced, and I have a kid!"
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,11,9,6,I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
Another Tour Guide,Peaceful,4,11,9,7,"I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,11,9,8,"All right, there you go!"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,11,9,9,"Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!"
Older Scientist,Powerful,4,11,9,10,"I'm Andrew, and I didn't pay for this pear."
Ross Geller,Mad,4,11,9,11,"Okay, good-good for you."
Tour Guide,Peaceful,4,11,9,12,"I'm Rhonda, and these aren't real!"
Ross Geller,Sad,4,11,9,13,"Wow, Rhonda."
Another Scientist,Powerful,4,11,9,14,I'm Scott.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,11,9,15,"Yeah, okay, Scott!"
Another Scientist,Scared,4,11,9,16,And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,11,11,2,Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,11,11,3,It depends on who asked.
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,11,11,4,What if I asked?
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,11,11,5,"Oh, Mon, sure."
Monica Geller,Scared,4,11,11,6,Really?
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,11,11,7,Yes. You're not asking are you?
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,11,11,8,No.
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,11,11,9,Yes! Totally!
Kathy,Joyful,4,11,11,11,Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes! Thank you!
Rachel Green,Mad,4,12,1,2,What the hell is that?!! What the hell is that? Is that you? Ohhhhhhh!
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,12,1,3,"Boy, you are really not a morning person."
Rachel Green,Mad,4,12,1,4,"BACK OFF!!! Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!"
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,12,1,6,What is that noise?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,12,1,7,You!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,12,1,8,It's the chick! She's...going through some changes.
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,12,1,9,What kind of changes?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,12,1,10,Well the vet seems to think that's she's becoming a rooster. We're getting a second opinion.
Dr. Zane,Powerful,4,12,3,2,It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,12,3,3,Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Frank Buffay Jr.,Peaceful,4,12,3,4,"Well, okay, so what's now-go get, go get the eggs, put 'em in there."
Dr. Zane,Powerful,4,12,3,5,"Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,12,3,6,"Embryossss? As in, ""More than one?"""
Dr. Zane,Powerful,4,12,3,7,"Um-hmm, five actually."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,12,3,8,"Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?"
Dr. Zane,Powerful,4,12,3,9,We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,12,3,10,That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Frank Buffay Jr.,Mad,4,12,3,11,"Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?"
Alice Knight,Peaceful,4,12,3,12,"Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,12,3,13,"Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right."
Frank Buffay Jr.,Peaceful,4,12,3,14,"Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right."
Alice Knight,Peaceful,4,12,3,15,"Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,12,3,16,"Whoa!! That-okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there-is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?"
Dr. Zane,Peaceful,4,12,3,17,"No, I'm sorry."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,4,12,3,18,Wow! You guys really don't know anything!
Frank Buffay Jr.,Joyful,4,12,3,19,I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,12,9,2,I can't find garbage bags!
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,12,9,3,"Oh, I think I saw some in here."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,12,9,5,What is it?!
Rachel Green,Sad,4,12,9,6,"I don't know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die."
Monica Geller,Scared,4,12,9,7,I can't believe we're living here!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,13,1,2,"Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!"
Ross Geller,Scared,4,13,1,3,People can hear you.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,13,1,4,I know!!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,13,1,6,Wow! She looks great. Doesn't she?
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,13,1,7,Yeah.
Kathy's Co-Star,Joyful,4,13,1,9,Hi!
Kathy,Joyful,4,13,1,10,Hi!
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,13,1,11,That is one good looking man!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,13,1,12,"Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!"
Kathy's Co-Star,Joyful,4,13,1,13,"Sooo, you've been doing this long?"
Kathy,Powerful,4,13,1,14,"No, you're my first. Put the money on the table."
Kathy's Co-Star,Joyful,4,13,1,16,"Oh, yeah! Ooh, that's nice."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,13,1,17,Dude!
Kathy's Co-Star,Joyful,4,13,1,18,Is that an expensive blouse?
Kathy,Powerful,4,13,1,19,If you want it to be.
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,13,1,21,Here's your girlfriend's button.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,13,2,2,"Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?"
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,13,2,3,"Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,13,2,4,"Well, it's just that maternity clothes are so expensive."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,13,2,6,"Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just......throw your purses at it."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,13,2,7,Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
Monica Geller,Scared,4,13,2,8,"Oh my God, are you out of a job?"
Rachel Green,Sad,4,13,2,9,"No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!"
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,13,2,10,Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,13,2,11,Uh-huh.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,13,2,12,That sounds great!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,13,2,13,Hey!
Monica Geller,Mad,4,13,2,14,"Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can't eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,13,2,15,There's gravy?
Monica Geller,Mad,4,13,2,16,"If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now."
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,13,2,18,What are you doing?
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,13,2,19,I think I left a donut up here.
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,13,3,2,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,13,3,3,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,13,3,4,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,13,3,5,Ooh! How was Kathy's play?
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,13,3,6,"Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin' guy."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,13,3,7,"Yeah, it's like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,13,3,8,That's a good idea for a business!
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,13,3,9,"I'm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they're gonna go to their cast parties and he's gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it'll be like, ""So where's your boyfriend, what's-his-name, Chester?"" And she'll go, ""No-no-no, it's Chandler."" And he'll go, ""Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"""
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,13,3,10,That-that is a good trick.
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,13,3,11,"All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,13,3,12,"Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,13,3,13,"Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,13,3,14,Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,13,3,15,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,13,3,16,"Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,13,3,17,They're not a couple!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,13,3,18,"Oh-okay, I get the game now."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,13,3,19,"Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,13,3,20,Oh yeah!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,13,3,21,"Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble."
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,13,3,22,Really?
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,13,3,23,"Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,13,3,24,No.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,13,3,25,Noooo!!
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,13,4,2,"So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?"
Ross Geller,Scared,4,13,4,3,"Y'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend."
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,13,4,4,"Yeah, I know but..."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,13,4,5,"Oh no-no-no, I'm there."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,13,4,6,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,13,4,7,Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,13,4,8,You made pancakes?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,13,4,9,Yep! Grab a plate.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,13,4,10,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,13,4,11,"No-no, stay right there. Gettin' closer."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,13,4,12,"Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I'm fairly certain are the same thing."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,13,4,13,"Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,13,4,14,Oh yeah!
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,13,4,15,"Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,13,4,16,"Oh yeah, who's playing?"
Monica Geller,Mad,4,13,4,17,The players.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,13,4,18,Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,13,4,19,"Please, it's a relief is what it is, is what it is."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,13,4,20,"All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,13,4,21,Oh.
Rachel Green,Scared,4,13,5,2,"Monica, I'm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn't even buy it! I'm telling you I'm quitting! That's it! I'm talking to my boss right now! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you."
Stephen Waltham,Peaceful,4,13,5,3,"In a moment, please, I'm in the middle of a task. And you have a customer."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,13,5,5,Hi!
Joshua Burgin,Neutral,4,13,5,6,"Hi, I'm Joshua."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,13,5,7,"Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?"
Joshua Burgin,Sad,4,13,5,8,"Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife..."
Rachel Green,Sad,4,13,5,9,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
Joshua Burgin,Sad,4,13,5,11,"Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,13,5,12,"Well, at least that's a great suit."
Joshua Burgin,Peaceful,4,13,5,13,"Yeah, but it wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt. So I need everything down to underwear, so if you're willing, I'm all yours."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,13,5,14,Okay.
Stephen Waltham,Powerful,4,13,5,15,"Rachel, you needed to speak to me?"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,13,5,16,"No-no, that wasn't me! Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. The selection of underwear we carry."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,13,5,18,"Oh-oh, sorry, it's this way, it's this way."
Joshua Burgin,Scared,4,13,5,19,It's this way? Sorry.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,13,6,2,"I'm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there's no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,13,6,3,"All right, let's not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,13,6,4,"Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!"
Ross Geller,Scared,4,13,6,5,"Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay? Just be cool, don't be...y'know you."
Kathy,Peaceful,4,13,6,6,Hey you guys!
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,13,6,7,Hey!
Kathy,Powerful,4,13,6,8,Hi! Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,13,6,9,"Oh, absolutely!"
Kathy,Joyful,4,13,6,10,Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
Kathy,Joyful,4,13,6,12,"It's a good play, isn't it?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,13,6,14,"Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you're having sex with him."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,13,6,15,"Okay, I..."
Kathy,Mad,4,13,6,16,"Clearly, I'm having sex with him?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,13,6,17,"Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!"
Kathy,Mad,4,13,6,18,"Okay, so let me just get this straight. You're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,13,6,19,"Y'know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing."
Kathy,Mad,4,13,6,20,"Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I'm-I'm playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!"
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,13,6,21,"Well, you can understand, given how we started."
Kathy,Mad,4,13,6,22,"Oh, wow. I can't believe you're throwing that in my face."
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,13,6,23,"Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this!"
Kathy,Mad,4,13,6,24,"I'll tell you what, Chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up!"
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,13,6,25,"Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen anytime soon!"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,13,9,2,Did she call?
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,4,13,9,3,"No, sorry."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,13,9,4,"All right, maybe I should call her."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,13,9,5,"No! Forget her, man! You don't need her, you don't need that!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,13,9,6,"He's right, what she did was unforgivable."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,13,9,7,"Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?"
Ross Geller,Scared,4,13,9,8,How might you be wrong?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,13,9,9,"Well y'know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?"
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,13,9,10,"Dude, tell me she actually told you this."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,13,9,11,"She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!"
Ross Geller,Scared,4,13,9,12,That's all you're basing this on?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,13,9,13,"That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,13,9,14,"Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,13,9,15,Oh my God!!
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,13,10,2,"Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too... Umm, who likes the Knicks-"
Joshua Burgin,Joyful,4,13,10,3,What do you think?
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,13,10,4,"Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!"
Joshua Burgin,Joyful,4,13,10,5,Huh. Yeah?
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,13,10,6,"Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. Umm, so you like it?"
Joshua Burgin,Joyful,4,13,10,7,"I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,13,10,8,Great.
Joshua Burgin,Peaceful,4,13,10,9,"All right, thank you so much for all your help."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,13,10,10,Sure.
Joshua Burgin,Joyful,4,13,10,11,"Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,13,10,12,Yeah-eah-ha!
Joshua Burgin,Powerful,4,13,10,13,"Thanks. Maybe I'll see in the spring, with the uh, y'know, for the uh, bathing suits."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,13,10,14,"Oh well, you don't want to do that now?!"
Joshua Burgin,Joyful,4,13,10,15,"Ah, that's okay, thanks."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,13,10,16,Okay.
Joshua Burgin,Neutral,4,13,10,17,"Anyway, hopefully, I'll see you around sometime."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,13,10,18,Basketball!
Joshua Burgin,Sad,4,13,10,19,I'm sorry.
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,13,10,20,"I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested, just as a thank you for this week."
Joshua Burgin,Powerful,4,13,10,21,Wow! That would be great.
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,13,10,22,Really?
Joshua Burgin,Joyful,4,13,10,23,"Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel."
Stephen Waltham,Neutral,4,13,10,24,Good morning.
Joshua Burgin,Peaceful,4,13,10,25,Hi!
Kathy,Joyful,4,13,11,2,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,13,11,3,"Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry. Y'know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset."
Kathy,Sad,4,13,11,4,Oh wow. I really wish you'd call me.
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,13,11,5,"Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y'know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? 'Cause we've had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y'know, I know for me- Nick's pants?"
Kathy,Neutral,4,13,11,6,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,13,11,7,"Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,14,1,2,"So now, what is this now?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,14,1,3,Guggly worm.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,14,1,4,And this?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,14,1,5,Glow-pop giggly jammer.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,14,1,6,You make it so funny.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,14,1,7,"Hey umm, what's this?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,14,1,8,"Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year."
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,14,1,9,"Ohh, Geller's got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! It's the classic struggle between man and- Someone knocked over a lamp."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,14,1,10,"That's all right. Hey you guys, you know what's going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, ""Joey, what are you doing with your life?"" stuff. I can say, ""Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"""
#ALL#,Joyful,4,14,1,11,Great!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,14,1,13,"You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here. Kathy didn't cheat on all of you. Well, except you."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,14,1,14,"Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?"
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,14,1,15,"Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,14,1,16,What's Phase Two?
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,14,1,17,Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,14,1,18,How does going to a strip club help him better?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,14,1,19,Because there are naked ladies there.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,14,1,20,"Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women."
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,14,1,21,There are naked ladies there too.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,14,1,22,Yeah.
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,14,1,23,Would you give me one minute!! Please.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,14,6,2,Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I'm here! I'm here!
The A.D,Peaceful,4,14,6,3,"Calm down, we got time, we're running a little late."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,14,6,5,"Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!"
The A.D,Joyful,4,14,6,6,"Yeah, we loves 'em. I've never seen him with-"
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,14,6,7,"Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?"
The A.D,Neutral,4,14,6,8,You.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,14,6,9,"Y'know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?"
The A.D,Joyful,4,14,6,10,You?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,14,6,11,"No-no, it's uh, it's Heston."
The A.D,Mad,4,14,6,12,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,14,6,13,"Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice."
The A.D,Powerful,4,14,6,14,"There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,14,6,15,"Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?"
The A.D,Joyful,4,14,6,16,"The one with ""Heston"" on it."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,14,6,17,Interesting.

The Cigarette Smoking Guy,Neutral,4,14,7,6,"Well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,14,7,7,"Ha-ha, it's not my baby, ha-ha-ha!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,14,7,9,"Very good, so good."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,14,7,10,"I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic."
Rachel Green,Scared,4,14,7,11,"Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call. I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,14,7,12,Come on! Look where you are!!
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,14,7,13,"When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,14,7,14,"Remember, a virgin for me please."

Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,14,7,17,"Well, if you think it will help."

Charlton Heston,Mad,4,14,8,6,Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,14,8,7,"No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I'm an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I'm doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink."

Charlton Heston,Joyful,4,14,8,10,"Joey, right?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,14,8,11,Yeah.
Charlton Heston,Peaceful,4,14,8,12,"Every actor at one time or another-opp! Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won't even watch himself."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,14,8,13,"Oh no-no-no, you don't understand..."
Charlton Heston,Powerful,4,14,8,14,Listen to me!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,14,8,15,"Oh yeah, yeah."
Charlton Heston,Powerful,4,14,8,16,"I don't know one actor worth his salt that didn't say at one time or another, ""God, I stink!"" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,14,8,17,"Yes sir! Yes sir, I'm-I'm-"

Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,14,10,4,Please?
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,14,10,5,I wanted to go to the strip club!
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,14,10,6,"I know, I know, but you're gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,14,10,7,"Yeah, all right."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,14,10,8,Hey!
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,14,10,9,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,14,10,10,"Hey-ooh so, how was Vermont?"

Rachel Green,Powerful,4,14,10,16,"Oh, hmm."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,14,10,17,"I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasn't quite there. Y'know, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guy..."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,14,10,18,Joshua.
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,14,10,19,"Joshua...guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kinda...y'know."

Ross Geller,Joyful,4,14,10,25,Happy for you.
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,14,10,26,"No, happy for you!"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,14,11,2,"All right ladies, here's what we're gonna do. You are gonna take off my clothes. You two, go get the oils. And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, ""Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"""
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,14,11,3,"I-I wanna be with her, I like her."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,14,11,4,"Oh, that's fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,14,11,5,"Wait, now, what am I doing again?"
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,14,11,6,"Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!"
The Cigarette Guy,Neutral,4,14,11,7,"Hi, I'm Joshua, I'm here to pick up Rachel."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,14,11,8,"No-no-no, that' not Joshua."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,14,11,9,"What do you want from me, I've never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay, but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. What are you doing? All right, listen, I've got to wake up!"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,15,1,2,"Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!"
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,15,1,3,"Chandler, there's a guy right over there."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,15,1,4,That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,15,1,5,"Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you any less of a guy! That does! What am I sitting on? I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,15,1,6,"Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?"
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,15,1,7,Hmm.
Woman,Joyful,4,15,1,8,OH...MY...GAWD!!
Emily Waltham,Scared,4,15,3,2,"I can't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,15,3,3,"No, it's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe."
Ross Geller,Scared,4,15,3,5,Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
Emily Waltham,Peaceful,4,15,3,6,"No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. Liam, Devon, this is Ross."
Devon,Peaceful,4,15,3,7,"Hey, mate."
Liam,Neutral,4,15,3,8,How are ya man?
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,15,3,9,"Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? Help! Help!"
Emily Waltham,Neutral,4,15,3,10,"So how are you? I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, I've been rather busy."
Devon,Neutral,4,15,3,11,Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,15,3,12,Oh my God. I think you're right.
Liam,Joyful,4,15,3,13,"Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning."
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,15,3,14,"Oh, Liam."
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,15,3,15,"Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something-or should I call it football?"
Devon,Neutral,4,15,3,16,We were playing rugby.
Liam,Joyful,4,15,3,17,In fact we're playing a game at the park tomorrow. You're welcome to play too if you want.
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,15,3,18,Ross play rugby? I don't think so.
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,15,3,19,"What's ah, what's so funny about that?"
Emily Waltham,Neutral,4,15,3,20,"Well I mean, you're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,15,3,21,"Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776, either so..."
Devon,Joyful,4,15,3,22,So good then! We'll see you at Riverside Park at 2:00! Cheers!
Liam,Joyful,4,15,3,23,Cheers!
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,15,3,24,Cheers!
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,4,15,4,2,"Oh boy, I just love to sing!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,15,4,3,"Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,4,15,4,4,"Oh, look at us! Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,15,4,5,"Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship..."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,4,15,4,6,"I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,15,4,7,Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,4,15,4,8,"Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time."
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,15,4,9,"I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,Sad,4,15,4,10,Oh no! Where to? Too Paris?
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,15,4,11,"No! No! Not, Paris."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,15,4,13,"Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,Neutral,4,15,4,14,When?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,15,4,15,I don't know exactly.
Janice Litman Goralnik,Scared,4,15,4,16,"Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,15,4,17,But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,15,5,2,Done?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,15,5,3,Yep!
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,15,5,4,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,15,5,5,Hey! What's up?
Monica Geller,Mad,4,15,5,6,"This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,15,5,7,I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,15,5,8,"Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light."
Monica Geller,Scared,4,15,5,9,"Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,15,5,10,It's coming from Joey!
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,15,5,11,"Oh my God, that's so freaky! Turn him off!!"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,15,7,2,"Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one-Dude! They're all huge!"
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,15,7,3,They don't look any bigger than me!
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,15,7,4,"Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are."
Emily Waltham,Peaceful,4,15,7,5,I'm just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,15,7,6,All right.
Emily Waltham,Peaceful,4,15,7,7,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,15,7,9,Hi.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,15,7,11,Whoa! I kinda liked it.
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,15,7,13,"Okay, I know what I have to do. I've got to go Red Ross. Y'know, Red Ross!"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,15,7,14,I totally don't know what you're talking about.
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,15,7,15,Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,15,7,16,No.
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,15,7,17,You'll see.
Emily Waltham,Peaceful,4,15,7,19,"Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it's his first time."
Liam,Mad,4,15,7,20,You don't say!
Emily Waltham,Peaceful,4,15,7,21,"Good luck, babe."
Liam,Joyful,4,15,7,23,Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! Ross! Come on!
Liam,Mad,4,15,7,25,"Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,15,7,27,JOEY!!!!!!
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,15,8,2,"You...are...not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?"
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,15,8,3,He asked you out?!
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,15,8,4,No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,15,8,5,Saucy!
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,15,8,6,What are these?
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,15,8,7,Electrical plans for the building.
Rachel Green,Scared,4,15,8,8,"Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?"
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,15,8,9,"I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,15,8,10,Wow! If only more people knew.
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,15,9,2,"Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Sad,4,15,9,3,"Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,15,9,4,"Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Scared,4,15,9,5,"On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane."
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,15,9,6,"Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen."
Ticket Counter Attendant,Neutral,4,15,9,7,One ticket to Yemen?
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,15,9,8,"Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket."
Ticket Counter Attendant,Neutral,4,15,9,9,"I'm sorry sir, I don't understand."
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,15,9,10,What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Ticket Counter Attendant,Neutral,4,15,9,11,Are you travelling with a child?
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,15,9,12,"No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card."
Ticket Counter Attendant,Neutral,4,15,9,13,"Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don't take library cards."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Joyful,4,15,9,14,What's the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,15,9,15,American Express?
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,15,11,2,Hey!
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,15,11,3,Hi!
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,15,11,4,What-what are-what are these?
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,15,11,5,"Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?"
Monica Geller,Mad,4,15,11,7,"No-no-no, no!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,15,11,9,"I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture."
Rachel Green,Mad,4,15,11,11,Oh my God! Look at this!
Monica Geller,Mad,4,15,11,12,"Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!"
Rachel Green,Mad,4,15,11,13,I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,15,11,14,I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
Rachel Green,Mad,4,15,11,15,And did you?!
Monica Geller,Scared,4,15,11,16,"No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,15,11,18,But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,15,11,19,Oh my God.
Mrs. Chatracus,Peaceful,4,15,11,20,Hello darling.
Rachel Green,Scared,4,15,11,21,"Hello, Mrs. Chatracus."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,15,12,2,"Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,15,12,3,"Oh no! That-that'll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y'know what? I'm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,15,12,4,"Yeah, sure."
Ross Geller,Mad,4,15,12,5,"No, not you."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,15,12,6,"Uhh, look, your eye's still popping out a little, I'm gonna go get some ice."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,15,12,7,"Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!"
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,15,12,8,You were amazing out there.
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,15,12,9,"Oh, I kinda was, wasn't I?"
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,15,12,10,Oh my God!
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,15,12,11,"I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks."
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,15,12,12,You really enjoyed yourself didn't you?
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,15,12,13,"Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose-I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you."
Emily Waltham,Scared,4,15,12,14,I think you've got concussion.
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,15,12,15,"No, no, I'm serious. Thank you."
Emily Waltham,Scared,4,15,12,16,You're welcome. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,15,12,17,"It's worth the pain. Y'know what, you know what? It's not."
Ticket Counter Attendant,Neutral,4,15,13,2,This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,15,13,3,"Well, I-I guess I gotta go."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Peaceful,4,15,13,4,"Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?"
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,15,13,5,"Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Neutral,4,15,13,6,"Oh. Well, I'll right you everyday. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,15,13,7,"Okay, good-bye. Good-bye."
Janice Litman Goralnik,Scared,4,15,13,9,Chandler?
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,15,13,10,No!
Janice Litman Goralnik,Sad,4,15,13,11,Chandler!
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,15,13,12,"Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!"
Janice Litman Goralnik,Sad,4,15,13,13,No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,15,13,14,"Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?"
Monica Geller,Scared,4,16,1,2,What is it hon?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,16,1,3,"I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No."
Monica Geller,Sad,4,16,1,4,"Aww, honey I'm sorry."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,16,1,5,God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,16,1,6,Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,16,1,8,Yeah?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,16,1,9,"It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen there's something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,16,1,11,Is it the shampoo? It's guava.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,16,1,12,No!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,16,1,13,Oh! Wait-wait! Is it my bologna sandwich?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,16,1,14,Yes. Yes. Yes. I can't believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can't eat meat!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,16,1,15,"Oh, wait-wait! Maybe it's a pickle?!"
Joshua Burgin,Powerful,4,16,3,2,Okay!
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,16,3,3,"Oh, here's that trench-coat that you wanted."
Joshua Burgin,Powerful,4,16,3,4,"Oh great! Wow! Yeah, it's comfortable."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,16,3,5,Yeah?
Joshua Burgin,Powerful,4,16,3,6,"Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,16,3,7,"Oh no-no, no-no, they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store."
Joshua Burgin,Joyful,4,16,3,8,Why not?!
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,16,3,9,"Well, that's because of a lot of..."
Joshua Burgin,Powerful,4,16,3,10,"Y'know, they ruin it for everybody."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,16,3,11,I know!
Joshua Burgin,Sad,4,16,3,12,"Y'know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,16,3,13,Oh?
Joshua Burgin,Powerful,4,16,3,14,"Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,16,3,15,"Well, congratulations, so do you love her?"
Joshua Burgin,Peaceful,4,16,3,16,"No, no, no, she's nice but, y'know, it just it made me realize that I'm just not, I'm just not ready to be dating, y'know?"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,16,3,17,"Huh. Well, uh, that's uh, that's interesting."
Joshua Burgin,Powerful,4,16,3,18,"Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?"
Rachel Green,Scared,4,16,3,19,"Oh, it's just an anti-theft device."
Joshua Burgin,Joyful,4,16,3,20,"Then uh, what's-what's this?"
Rachel Green,Scared,4,16,3,21,"You need that, you need that too 'cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,16,7,2,"Oooh, what you got there?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,16,7,3,Pastrami.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,16,7,4,"Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y'know what goes good with that?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,16,7,5,"Hm-mm, corn beef."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,16,7,6,"Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,16,7,7,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,16,7,8,Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,16,7,9,Six months.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,16,7,10,"Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,16,7,11,Not if I get there first.
Mr. Treeger,Joyful,4,17,1,2,"Ohhh, man!!"
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,17,1,3,What is that?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,17,1,4,Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
Mr. Treeger,Peaceful,4,17,1,5,What in the name of hell?
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,17,1,6,Maybe he found you flip-flop.
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,17,1,8,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,17,1,9,Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,17,1,10,Do we pay for this?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,17,1,11,"No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us."
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,17,1,12,Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,17,1,13,Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
Mr. Treeger,Joyful,4,17,1,14,"Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,17,1,15,"Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!"
Mr. Treeger,Neutral,4,17,1,16,"Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,17,1,17,Like finding money with naked people on it!
Mr. Treeger,Peaceful,4,17,1,18,"Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I'm sad."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,17,1,19,Why would he turn off the TV?
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,17,2,2,"All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?"
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,17,2,4,We don't know what could make this go away.
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,17,2,5,"Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,17,2,6,And no one touches the air around the TV!
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,17,2,7,"Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?"
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,17,2,8,"Well at least, I'm going to mute it."
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,17,2,10,We still have porn.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,17,2,11,Hey.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,17,2,12,Hi!
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,17,2,13,Hi!
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,17,2,14,"Honey, what are you doing? That's too heavy."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,17,2,15,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,17,2,16,"Give it here. Oh, God."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,17,2,17,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,17,2,18,"Ohh, I'm getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y'know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,17,2,19,Or a job where you don't have to carry a table.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,17,2,20,You mean like a doctor?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,17,2,21,Pheebs! You're blocking the porn! Look out!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,17,2,22,"Ohh! Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,17,3,2,Hi.
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,17,3,3,Hi.
Ross Geller,Scared,4,17,3,4,"So uh, Emily just went to the airport."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,17,3,5,Oh. Why didn't you take her?
Ross Geller,Scared,4,17,3,6,"Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y'know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so..."
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,17,3,7,You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,17,3,8,Nah.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,17,3,9,"Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?"
Ross Geller,Scared,4,17,3,10,"Well I, that's the thing, I don't know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, ""This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let's just enjoy..."""
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,17,3,11,"No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,17,3,12,And why do you care so much?
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,17,3,13,Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,17,3,14,You had fantasies about Emily?
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,17,3,15,"No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,17,3,16,Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,17,3,17,"Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!"
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,17,3,18,Ahh.
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,17,3,19,Do you love her?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,17,3,20,"We said it was only going to be two weeks, y'know?"
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,17,3,21,You love her!
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,17,3,22,What-what is love really?
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,17,3,23,"Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, ""I love you!"" And she's gonna say, ""I love you, too!"" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,17,3,24,I am a good kisser.
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,17,3,25,"Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,17,4,2,Is that the heartbeat?
The Doctor,Joyful,4,17,4,3,That's it.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,17,4,4,Oh my God!
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,17,4,5,Oh wow! This is so cool.
The Doctor,Powerful,4,17,4,7,Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,17,4,8,"Why don't take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?"
The Doctor,Powerful,4,17,4,9,"No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,17,4,10,Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one!
The Doctor,Mad,4,17,4,11,Doctors are wrong all the time.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,17,4,12,"Well, yeah."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,17,4,13,"Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!"
The Doctor,Peaceful,4,17,4,14,Definitely.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,17,4,15,Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I'm going to have three full grown babies just walkin' around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it's gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
The Doctor,Joyful,4,17,4,16,"Actually, giving birth to three babies isn't that different from giving birth to one."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,17,4,17,What do you know?!
Alice Knight,Joyful,4,17,5,2,"Oh-oh, Phoebe!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,17,5,3,Ooh! Hi!
Alice Knight,Joyful,4,17,5,4,"Hi! So, how did it go at the doctors?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,17,5,5,"Oh well, okay, hey, y'know how when you're umm, you're walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, ""Oh, that's nice?"""
Frank Buffay Jr.,Neutral,4,17,5,6,Yes.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,17,5,7,"Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies."
Alice Knight,Powerful,4,17,5,8,Three babies?
Frank Buffay Jr.,Joyful,4,17,5,9,I finally got my band!
Alice Knight,Joyful,4,17,5,10,"We're gonna have a big family, I've always wanted a big family!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,17,5,11,"Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked."
Frank Buffay Jr.,Powerful,4,17,5,12,Why would we be freaked?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,17,5,13,"No, no maybe 'cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and..."
Frank Buffay Jr.,Joyful,4,17,5,14,Oh.
Alice Knight,Neutral,4,17,5,15,Right.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,17,5,16,"No, back to happy. Back to happy!"
Alice Knight,Powerful,4,17,5,17,"No-no-no, no, it's going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y'know it'll-it'll be like my very own little sweatshop."
Frank Buffay Jr.,Neutral,4,17,5,18,"Yeah, I've been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job."
Alice Knight,Peaceful,4,17,5,19,"No, Frank."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,17,5,20,No you can't quit college! No! You're in college? Really?
Frank Buffay Jr.,Neutral,4,17,5,21,"Yeah, refrigerator college."
Alice Knight,Neutral,4,17,5,22,Yeah.
Frank Buffay Jr.,Powerful,4,17,5,23,"Yeah, y'know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y'know I figured y'know like I should y'know have like a career-and I love refrigerators!"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,17,5,24,You can't give up on your dream.
Frank Buffay Jr.,Powerful,4,17,5,25,"No, it's okay. We're-we're gonna have three kids! And that's-that's a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money."
Ticket Agent,Neutral,4,17,6,2,This is the boarding call for Flight 009.
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,17,6,3,Emily!
Emily Waltham,Mad,4,17,6,4,Oh my God! What are you doing here?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,17,6,5,"I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off."
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,17,6,6,You are so sweet.
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,17,6,7,"That's, that's, that's a big candy bar. I had the most amazing time with you."
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,17,6,8,Me too.
Ticket Agent,Neutral,4,17,6,9,This is the final boarding call for Flight 009.
Emily Waltham,Peaceful,4,17,6,10,"Well, that' me. Here, have this. I'm only allowed one piece of carryon anyway."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,17,6,11,"Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I've been thinking, I'm just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you."
Emily Waltham,Powerful,4,17,6,12,Oh. Thank you.
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,17,6,13,That's no problem.
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,17,8,2,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,17,8,3,"Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,17,8,4,"Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,17,8,5,Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,17,8,6,"Ooh, good, you're hear! Okay."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,17,8,7,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,17,8,8,Hi!
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,17,8,9,"Well, what-what 'cha got there?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,17,8,10,"Oh this, well I'm glad you asked. Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? Ahh! Now, I know what you're thinking..."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,17,8,11,Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
Monica Geller,Scared,4,17,8,12,"Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?"
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,17,8,13,No!
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,17,8,14,Are you sure?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,17,8,15,No!
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,17,8,16,"Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,17,8,17,"No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan."
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,17,8,18,What's the second part of your plan?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,17,8,19,My Saturn dealership.
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,17,9,2,Hello?
Emily Waltham,Neutral,4,17,9,3,Ross.
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,17,9,4,"Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?"
Emily Waltham,Peaceful,4,17,9,5,It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
Ross Geller,Scared,4,17,9,6,"No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called."
Emily Waltham,Scared,4,17,9,7,"Ross umm, there's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else."
Ross Geller,Scared,4,17,9,8,Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,17,10,2,"She doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,17,10,3,"This isn't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,17,10,4,Well...
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,17,10,5,Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,17,10,6,"I'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,17,10,7,You put your fist through the wall?
Ross Geller,Sad,4,17,10,8,"No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,17,10,9,You have to go to London!
Ross Geller,Scared,4,17,10,10,What?
Monica Geller,Mad,4,17,10,11,"Yeah, you have to go fight for her!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,17,10,12,"Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. 'Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!"
Monica Geller,Sad,4,17,10,13,"When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,17,10,14,I made fun of his accent.
Monica Geller,Sad,4,17,10,15,"You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,17,10,16,No.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,17,10,17,"All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!"
Ross Geller,Scared,4,17,10,18,Really?
Monica Geller,Mad,4,17,10,19,Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,17,10,20,"All right. All right, I'm gonna do it!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,17,10,21,All right.
Ross Geller,Scared,4,17,10,22,"I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,17,10,23,"Okay, good luck!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,17,10,25,"Ross! Ross! If you're going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,17,11,2,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,17,11,3,Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,17,11,4,"That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,17,11,5,"Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised..."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,17,11,6,I'm telling it! I'm telling it!
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,17,11,7,Okay.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,17,11,8,"Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I've got?"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,17,11,9,A place where no one will ever get out alive?
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,17,11,10,"No! Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's..."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,17,11,11,Relaxi-Taxi!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,17,11,12,The name was my favourite part!
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,17,11,13,"Well, well I can up with it!"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,17,11,14,YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That's not good.
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,17,11,15,"Well, I..."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,17,11,17,Hello.
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,17,11,18,Hey.
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,17,11,19,"Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?"
Ross Geller,Mad,4,17,11,21,"No, because she hasn't come home yet. And she hasn't been home all night! She's obviously staying with that other guy, and I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!"
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,17,11,22,"All right. When is, when is the next flight out?"
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,17,11,23,About four hours.
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,17,11,24,"Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,17,11,25,"Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,17,11,26,"Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like taxicab."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,17,11,27,"Oh, that is better."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,17,12,2,Are we in London?
Monica Geller,Mad,4,17,12,3,What are you doing here? You can't be here!
Emily Waltham,Scared,4,17,12,4,"I've uh, I've come to talk to Ross."
Emily Waltham,Scared,4,17,12,6,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,17,12,7,"Nothing. No, nothing."
Emily Waltham,Scared,4,17,12,8,"I was going to call him, but..."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,17,12,9,"Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! I was right! I'm right, right?"
Emily Waltham,Scared,4,17,12,10,I'd really rather talk to him.
Monica Geller,Sad,4,17,12,11,Oh.
Emily Waltham,Scared,4,17,12,12,"I uh, I've been to his apartment and he wasn't there, and uh. I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?"
Emily Waltham,Scared,4,17,12,14,"Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this but... I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you."
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,17,12,15,"I love you too! I'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth! You can't hear me."
Emily Waltham,Sad,4,17,12,16,"I wish I could know if you'd heard any of that. I suppose I've either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you're listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there's not much chance you did heard that, and there's the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well. Hello."
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,17,12,17,Hi.
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,17,12,18,"Ross, I love you!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,17,12,19,Ohh! Thank you.
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,17,13,2,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,17,13,3,Hey.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,17,13,4,"I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,17,13,5,"Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,17,13,6,"What, no, ""Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"""
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,17,13,7,Noo! Nothing!
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,17,13,8,"Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,17,13,9,I think you're right.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,17,13,11,"All right, ready?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,17,13,12,One.

Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,18,1,2,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,18,1,3,"Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,18,1,4,"Ha-ha. No, it's just I'm so pregnant that I-my guitar doesn't fit anymore. So I thought 'til I'm not, I'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,18,1,5,All right.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,18,1,6,"Listen. Listen. Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,18,1,7,"Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,18,1,8,"I know! I know, and I've only been playing for like an hour!"
Alice Knight,Joyful,4,18,1,9,Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,18,1,10,Hey! What are you doing here?
Alice Knight,Peaceful,4,18,1,11,"Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,4,18,1,12,"Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus."
Alice Knight,Joyful,4,18,1,13,"No. No. No. Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR."
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,18,1,14,Wouldn't that be Frank the III?
Alice Knight,Joyful,4,18,1,15,"Don't get me started. Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,18,1,16,Wow! That's so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.
Alice Knight,Joyful,4,18,1,17,You think about it.
Emily Waltham,Mad,4,18,2,2,"I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised?"
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,18,2,3,"Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra."
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,18,2,4,"Ohh, it's time to go."
Ross Geller,Scared,4,18,2,5,"Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock's a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?"
Emily Waltham,Neutral,4,18,2,6,Well that's ambitious.
Ross Geller,Sad,4,18,2,8,"Hey, uh, you can ignore that."
Emily Waltham,Peaceful,4,18,2,9,That's Carol with your son!
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,18,2,10,"Uhh, believe me when he's older, he'll understand."
Carol Willick,Scared,4,18,2,11,Ross!
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,18,2,12,"I'll be right there. Hello! Hello! Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan."
Susan Bunch,Joyful,4,18,2,13,"Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you!"
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,18,2,14,Me too!
Carol Willick,Powerful,4,18,2,15,"Ohh, y'know, Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week."
Susan Bunch,Joyful,4,18,2,16,"Oh yeah, I'm so excited, I've never been there."
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,18,2,17,"Oh, well, I'll show you around."
Susan Bunch,Joyful,4,18,2,18,"That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions..."
Emily Waltham,Scared,4,18,2,19,"Oh, there's tonnes of terrific stuff-I'll go with you!"
Susan Bunch,Peaceful,4,18,2,20,Ahh!
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,18,2,22,"Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so..."
Emily Waltham,Powerful,4,18,2,23,Are you all right?
Susan Bunch,Powerful,4,18,2,24,"Oh, he's fine. He's fine. It's just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn't like me."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,18,2,25,Oh come on! That's-that's... true.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,18,3,2,Hi!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,18,3,3,Hey!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,18,3,4,Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,18,3,5,"Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book and found nothing! I want a name that's really like, y'know strong and confident, y'know? Like-like Exxon."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,18,3,6,"Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,18,3,7,"Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,18,3,8,"No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with ""The."""
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,18,3,9,"Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. ""Where is everybody?"" ""Well, they're hanging out with Joey."""
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,18,3,10,"Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,18,3,11,"Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,18,3,12,"Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,18,3,13,What do ya say? What do ya say?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,18,3,14,"Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,18,3,15,I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,18,4,2,"Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing."
Monica Geller,Scared,4,18,4,3,Y'know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,18,4,4,Sorry. I'm so exited! I've been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I'm making him a very fancy meal.
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,18,4,5,Um-hmm.
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,18,4,6,What am I making him by the way?
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,18,4,7,"Well, you're making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,18,4,8,I thought I was making him filet mignon?
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,18,4,9,"Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking, and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke."
Rachel Green,Mad,4,18,4,10,"Wow, I really get crabby when I cook."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,18,7,2,Hey!
Carol Willick,Mad,4,18,7,3,Hey! How's Ben?
Ross Geller,Sad,4,18,7,4,"Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, ""No."" I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, ""No."" I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, ""No."" So, he's sweeping."
Carol Willick,Powerful,4,18,7,5,"Hey, Ben! Hey!"
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,18,7,6,"So umm, any word from Susan?"
Carol Willick,Joyful,4,18,7,7,"Ooh, yeah! She said she's having sooo much fun with Emily."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,18,7,8,"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don't know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?"
Carol Willick,Scared,4,18,7,9,What's too much fun?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,18,7,10,"Y'know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married."
Carol Willick,Powerful,4,18,7,11,"Oh my God, you are so paranoid!"
Ross Geller,Mad,4,18,7,12,Am I?!
Carol Willick,Peaceful,4,18,7,13,Yes!
Ross Geller,Mad,4,18,7,14,Am I?!
Carol Willick,Joyful,4,18,7,15,"I can't speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship."
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,18,7,16,"Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y'know? Say-say they're coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they're laughing, y'know, someone innocently touches someone else... There's electricity, it's new. It's exciting. Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility of something happening?"
Carol Willick,Scared,4,18,7,17,Maybe.
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,18,7,18,OH MY GOD!! I didn't really believe it until you just said it!!
Joshua Burgin,Scared,4,18,8,2,"...and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!"
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,18,8,3,Wow! This place is fabulous!
Joshua Burgin,Peaceful,4,18,8,4,"Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,18,8,5,"Whoa-whoa, there's two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet."
Joshua Burgin,Neutral,4,18,8,6,"Yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,18,8,7,"Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?"
Joshua Burgin,Peaceful,4,18,8,9,"Hey, here's an idea. Why don't uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?"
Rachel Green,Scared,4,18,8,10,"That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?"
Joshua Burgin,Joyful,4,18,8,11,"Oh yeah, yeah uh, it's down the hall and uh, second door to your left."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,18,8,12,Ah.
Mrs. Burgin,Joyful,4,18,8,14,"Oh, hi, darling!"
Joshua Burgin,Powerful,4,18,8,15,"Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?"
Mrs. Burgin,Joyful,4,18,8,16,"Oh, well we cut the trip short."
Mr. Burgin,Neutral,4,18,8,17,France sucks!
Joshua Burgin,Joyful,4,18,8,18,"Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here."
Mrs. Burgin,Sad,4,18,8,19,"Oh, say no more!"
Mr. Burgin,Neutral,4,18,8,20,"We'll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and we'll be right out of you hair."
Joshua Burgin,Scared,4,18,8,21,"Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn't even get to Italy?"
Mr. Burgin,Joyful,4,18,8,22,"Yep, sucks!"
Rachel Green,Scared,4,18,8,24,Hi you!
Joshua Burgin,Powerful,4,18,8,25,Oh my God!
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,18,8,26,"I know, I can do more than cook."
Mr. Burgin,Peaceful,4,18,8,28,I like her. She sees smart.
Joshua Burgin,Peaceful,4,18,9,2,"Uhh, Rachel, my parents..."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,18,9,3,Ohh! It's so nice to meet you. Hello.
Mr. Burgin,Peaceful,4,18,9,4,Hi.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,18,9,5,Hello.
Mrs. Burgin,Powerful,4,18,9,6,"Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries."
Rachel Green,Scared,4,18,9,7,"What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not-that's-that's not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It's-it's, they're-they're wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's, so... And obviously in uh, in-in this case, I am going to report back, ""USA not ready."""
Mrs. Burgin,Powerful,4,18,9,8,Maybe in L.A?
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,18,9,9,Yes!
Joshua Burgin,Joyful,4,18,9,10,There you go.
Mr. Burgin,Peaceful,4,18,9,11,"So, have you kids eaten yet?"
Rachel Green,Sad,4,18,9,12,"Well, we were going to do that after-I mean umm, next."
Mr. Burgin,Peaceful,4,18,9,13,"Well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat?"
Rachel Green,Sad,4,18,9,14,"Oh, yeah, well... Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin' around the house."
Mr. Burgin,Peaceful,4,18,9,15,So... We go eat.
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,18,9,16,Yes.
Mr. Burgin,Peaceful,4,18,9,17,"You'll wear that. We'll be eating, and of course, you'll be wearing that."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,18,10,2,"Dude, I am sorry about what I said!"
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,18,10,3,"No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,18,10,4,It's not that bad.
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,18,10,5,"Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,18,10,6,"So, you're just Bing?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,18,10,7,I have no name.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,18,10,8,"All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,18,10,9,"Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,18,10,10,No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,18,10,11,"Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,18,10,12,"Umm, Gene."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,18,10,13,It's Clint. It's Clint!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,18,10,14,"See you later, Gene."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,18,10,15,"Bye, Gene."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,18,10,16,It's Clint! Clint!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,18,10,17,What's up with Gene?
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,18,12,2,Drum roll.
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,18,12,3,"Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,18,12,4,"Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,18,12,5,"All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,18,12,6,You're actually going through with this?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,18,12,7,"Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women... So, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,18,12,8,"You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact-yes, I'm, I'm sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I'm-I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna name the baby Chandler."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,18,12,9,Really?!
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,18,12,10,"Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!"
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,18,12,11,Okay. Thanks.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,18,12,12,Okay!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,18,12,13,You wanna hug it out?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,18,12,14,Yeah!
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,18,12,16,Yay!
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,18,12,17,Yay!
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,4,18,12,18,"Yay-oh-yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,18,12,19,Okay!
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,18,12,20,"Ooh, uh..."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,18,12,21,"Bye, Pheebs!"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,18,12,22,"Okay, bye!"
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,18,12,24,Ha! Ha! Ha!

Rachel Green,Joyful,4,19,1,6,I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,19,1,7,Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning's here! Morning is here-
Rachel Green,Mad,4,19,1,8,Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,19,1,9,"Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did."
Rachel Green,Mad,4,19,1,10,"Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!"
Monica Geller,Scared,4,19,1,11,"Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!"
Rachel Green,Sad,4,19,1,12,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,19,1,13,Okay.
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,19,1,14,"See, this is a great apartment."
Monica Geller,Mad,4,19,1,15,Shut up! This place is a hole!
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,19,2,2,"Oh, blimey, I still can't believe you've got an earring!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,19,2,4,"Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?"
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,19,2,5,He does that?!
Ross Geller,Scared,4,19,2,6,"Uh, I don't know, whatever."
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,19,2,7,I think it makes you look really dangerous.
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,19,2,8,"Oh, I know. Y'know what, I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you. No really, when I'm with you I'm-I'm like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!"
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,19,2,9,I love both of you!
Ross Geller,Scared,4,19,2,10,Yeah?
Emily Waltham,Sad,4,19,2,12,I wish I didn't have to go.
Ross Geller,Sad,4,19,2,13,"Then don't. Stay here. Just don't go so soon to London, just one more day."
Emily Waltham,Sad,4,19,2,14,"Ohh, Ross, please!"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,19,2,15,"One more day, seriously/"
Emily Waltham,Sad,4,19,2,16,"Don't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me."
Ross Geller,Sad,4,19,2,17,"So, then you can stay as long as you want."
Emily Waltham,Sad,4,19,2,18,I wish I could.
Ross Geller,Sad,4,19,2,19,"Oh no. Don't, don't, don't start packing. Come on!"
Emily Waltham,Scared,4,19,2,20,"I don't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here."
Ross Geller,Sad,4,19,2,21,"Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on."
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,19,2,22,You didn't!
Ross Geller,Sad,4,19,2,23,"No. No, I didn't. I didn't want to be that guy."

Marjorie,Joyful,4,20,9,20,I talk in my sleep.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,20,9,21,"What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,20,9,22,So why don't you give me your number?
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,20,10,2,"Okay, ready?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,20,10,3,Yeah.

Monica Geller,Neutral,4,20,10,11,Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,20,10,12,Okay.
Monica Geller,Sad,4,20,10,13,That was a terrible throw!!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,20,10,14,I'm not gonna right to you! That's not real!
Monica Geller,Sad,4,20,10,15,"Look at me! My big concern is what's real?! Oh my God. We're really sad, aren't we?"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,4,20,10,16,"Yeah, I think we are."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,20,10,17,This isn't even my dress.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,20,10,18,"Well, at least you didn't rent yours from a store called, ""It's Not Too Late."""
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,20,10,19,I'm changing out of this.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,20,10,20,Me too.
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,20,10,21,In like a half-hour?
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,20,10,22,Me too.
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,20,10,23,"Okay, throw it straight this time."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,20,10,24,Okay.
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,20,10,26,I'm getting married next!!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,20,10,27,Yay!
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,20,11,2,I hate my regular clothes now! Y'know? I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,20,11,3,"Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn't you start feeling silly?"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,4,20,11,4,I guess.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,20,11,6,Oh my God!
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,20,11,7,Oh God.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,20,11,8,"Oh, you're such a cheater!"
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,20,11,9,Hello! Little ones.
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,20,11,10,Hey!
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,20,11,11,Hey!
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,20,11,12,"So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,20,11,13,"Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,20,11,14,"Oh, how'd that happen?"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,20,11,15,Because I'm cooler.
Monica Geller,Sad,4,20,11,16,"No, seriously."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,20,11,17,"Well she's, she's the kinda girl-Joey was unconscious."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,20,11,19,Hey you guys! What's happening?
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,20,11,20,Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,20,11,21,What is that?
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,20,11,22,"Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,20,11,23,"Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? 'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!"
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,20,11,24,I know I don't have too! It tastes good.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,20,11,25,"Plus, you look cool."
Emily Waltham,Scared,4,21,2,2,So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
Ross Geller,Scared,4,21,2,3,"Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he's so cheap, he'd never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough?"
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,21,2,4,"Yeah, they're fine."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,21,2,5,Yeah?
Emily Waltham,Powerful,4,21,2,6,"If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them. Oh! So you invited Rachel then?"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,21,2,7,Sure. Why not?
Emily Waltham,Scared,4,21,2,8,Really?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,21,2,9,Yeah?
Emily Waltham,Powerful,4,21,2,10,I don't think I'd be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,21,2,11,"Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn't invite her?"
Emily Waltham,Sad,4,21,2,12,"Oh, no-no, y'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it's absolutely your decision. More tea?"
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,21,2,13,Yeah sure.
Emily Waltham,Mad,4,21,2,14,Earl Grey?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,21,2,15,"Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want."
Ross Geller,Mad,4,21,3,2,"I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,21,3,4,And I just want a million dollars!
Monica Geller,Scared,4,21,3,5,Rachel?!
Rachel Green,Mad,4,21,3,6,"Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!"
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,21,3,8,"Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,21,3,9,"Hi, sure!"
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,21,3,10,Hi.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,21,4,2,"You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,21,4,3,I knew.
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,21,4,4,You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,21,4,5,I did.
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,21,4,6,"Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here-but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?"
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,21,4,7,"Yeah, maybe..."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,21,4,8,"Okay... okay, maybe I will..."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,21,5,2,"See, I see.... big passion in your future."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,21,5,3,Really?
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,21,5,4,I do.
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,21,5,5,"Oh Ross, you're so great."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,21,5,7,It's never gonna happen.
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,21,6,2,"Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,21,6,3,Okay.
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,21,6,4,"Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
Rachel Green,Scared,4,21,6,5,Ohhh!!!!
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,21,6,6,"Yes, yes, that's right..."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,21,6,7,"Oh, look at the little cat! Look at it!"
Ross Geller,Scared,4,21,6,8,What? Ow!
Rachel Green,Mad,4,21,7,2,"All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!"
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,21,7,4,Yes! Did you see that?
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,21,7,5,"You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,21,7,6,I could not have done this without you.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,21,7,8,"Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine."
Ross Geller,Mad,4,21,8,2,You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Rachel Green,Sad,4,21,8,3,What?
Ross Geller,Mad,4,21,8,4,I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Rachel Green,Mad,4,21,8,5,"Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?"
Ross Geller,Mad,4,21,8,7,"The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed."
Rachel Green,Mad,4,21,8,9,"Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross."
Ross Geller,Mad,4,21,8,10,Fine.
Rachel Green,Mad,4,21,8,11,'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Ross Geller,Mad,4,21,8,12,Good.
Rachel Green,Mad,4,21,8,13,Good.
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,21,9,2,Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
Ross Geller,Sad,4,21,9,3,"No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore."
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,21,9,4,Well neither do I!
Ross Geller,Scared,4,21,9,5,Is this about Mark?
Rachel Green,Scared,4,21,9,6,Oh my God.
Ross Geller,Mad,4,21,9,7,"Okay, it's not, it's not."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,21,9,8,"Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,21,9,9,"Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do."
Rachel Green,Scared,4,21,9,10,"I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,21,9,11,"Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something.."
Rachel Green,Sad,4,21,9,12,No. A break from us.

Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,21,10,3,"Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!"

Ross Geller,Powerful,4,21,10,12,"Yes, you can, very much."
Ross Geller,Scared,4,21,10,14,Ahhhh!!
Rachel Green,Mad,4,21,11,2,"Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!"

Chandler Bing,Scared,4,21,11,8,Uh-oh.

Rachel Green,Neutral,4,21,11,11,Was she good?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,21,11,13,Don't answer that.
Rachel Green,Mad,4,21,11,15,"Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?"
Ross Geller,Scared,4,21,11,16,She was...
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,21,11,18,Awful! Horrible!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,21,11,19,She was not good. Not good.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,21,11,20,She was nothing compared to you.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,21,11,22,"She, she was different."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,21,11,24,Ewwwww!
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,21,11,25,Uh-oh.
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,21,11,27,Good different?
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,21,11,28,Nobody likes change.
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,21,11,30,"What? Okay, okay, okay, okay."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,21,14,2,You seem to really like her.
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,21,14,3,"Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,21,14,4,"Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,21,14,5,You think?
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,21,14,6,"Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip."
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,21,14,7,"Hey, you're right."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,21,14,8,Yeah.
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,21,16,2,Who's this from?
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,21,16,3,"Oh, that's Ross's."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,21,16,4,Oh... Oh my God. He remembered.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,21,16,5,Remembered what?
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,21,16,6,"It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,21,16,7,"Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,21,16,8,I can't believe he did this.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,21,16,9,"Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?"
Rachel Green,Scared,4,21,16,11,What did you just say?
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,21,16,12,F-hah.... flennin....
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,21,16,13,Oh.... my God.
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,21,21,2,"Rach, I got a message from you."
Rachel Green,Scared,4,21,21,4,"Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . ."
Ross Geller,Sad,4,21,21,5,You're over me?
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,21,21,6,Ohhhhhhhh God.
Ross Geller,Sad,4,21,21,7,"Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?"
Rachel Green,Sad,4,21,21,8,"Ohh, ohh."
Ross Geller,Scared,4,21,21,9,"When, when were you... under me?"
Rachel Green,Scared,4,21,21,10,"Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you."
Ross Geller,Scared,4,21,21,12,"OK, I need to lie down."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,21,22,2,"He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,21,22,3,Really?
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,21,22,4,"Really. It's always been you, Rach."
Rachel Green,Scared,4,21,22,5,"Oh, god."
Ross Geller,Mad,4,21,25,2,"Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?"
Rachel Green,Scared,4,21,25,3,"Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!"
Ross Geller,Scared,4,21,25,4,You still love me?
Rachel Green,Mad,4,21,25,5,Noo.
Ross Geller,Scared,4,21,25,7,"What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?"
Rachel Green,Scared,4,21,25,8,"Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know."
Ross Geller,Mad,4,21,25,9,What?!
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,21,25,10,"I just, I feel, I-I just..."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,21,29,2,"All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! ""It's almost as good as being there."""
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,21,29,3,It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,21,29,4,"Well, You could, but... probably just the one time."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,21,29,5,"I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,21,29,6,"If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,21,29,7,Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,4,22,1,2,That's like the tenth time I've peed since I've been here!
Monica Geller,Mad,4,22,1,3,That's also like the tenth time you told us.
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,4,22,1,4,"Yeah, oh I'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I'm so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, 'cause-Oh! I'm pregnant!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,22,1,5,"Pheebs, did...you want a cookie?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,22,1,6,Thank you so much.
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,22,1,7,"So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?"
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,22,1,8,I haven't really had any yet.
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,22,2,2,Hey guys!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,22,2,3,Hey.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,22,2,4,Hey!
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,22,2,5,"All right, here's the ring."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,22,2,6,"Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!"
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,22,2,7,"So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?"
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,22,2,8,"Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don't you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?"
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,22,2,9,"Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward. It's awkward."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,22,2,10,I sort've already asked Chandler.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,22,2,11,What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,22,2,12,"Joey, I figured you'd understand. I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,22,2,13,"Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,22,2,14,You can be the best man when I get married.
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,22,2,15,I'll never get to be a best man!
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,22,2,16,"Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?"
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,22,2,17,"Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,22,2,18,What about me?! You-you just said I could!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,22,2,19,"I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,22,2,20,I can't believe you're not picking me.
Ross Geller,Mad,4,22,2,21,"Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!"
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,22,2,22,I'm not even... I'm not even...
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,22,2,23,"Fine, y'know what, that's it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,22,2,24,Yes! Shame about you man.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,22,4,2,"This is what I've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor."
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,22,4,3,Great. Great.
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,22,4,4,"Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I've got you, me, and Chandler and I'm gonna invite Gunther 'cause, well, we've been talking about this pretty loud."
Gunther,Neutral,4,22,4,5,I'll be there.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,22,4,6,"All right-oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,22,4,7,"Yeah. Tell ya what, let's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,22,4,8,Okay! We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,22,4,9,"Hey guys, what are you doing?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,22,4,10,"Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,22,4,11,"Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,22,4,12,"Yeah, see, I don't think it's gonna that difficult considering this one won't be taking place in the basement of a Pizza Hut."
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,22,4,13,"Oh, I'm Ross. I'm Ross. I'm too good for the Hut; I'm too good for the Hut."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,22,4,14,"Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,22,4,15,You got it.
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,22,4,16,"Okay, see ya later."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,22,4,17,See ya. Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,22,4,18,"Well, there's gonna be strippers there. He didn't say anything about no strippers."
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,22,4,19,"He just said, ""No strippers."""
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,22,4,20,"Oh, I chose not to hear that."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,22,5,2,Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! Can you believe they make these for little people?
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,22,5,3,Little village people.
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,22,5,4,"Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,22,5,5,"Oh, that is so sweet!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,22,5,6,I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Rachel Green,Sad,4,22,5,7,"Huh. Except, Phoebe's not gonna be the one that gets to dress them."
Monica Geller,Sad,4,22,5,8,Because she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
Rachel Green,Scared,4,22,5,9,Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,22,5,10,"Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she's done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,22,5,11,"Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she's always wanted!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,22,5,12,"Oh, she's gonna love that!"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,22,9,2,"The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!"
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,22,9,3,What?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,22,9,4,The ring is gone!
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,22,9,5,"Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this-Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You're the worst best man ever!"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,22,9,6,"Dude, this isn't funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything's cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!"
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,22,9,7,You slept with the stripper?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,22,9,8,Of course!!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,22,10,2,"Hi, guys."
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,22,10,3,Hi! Phoebe.
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,22,10,4,Hi Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,4,22,10,5,"I-I wanted to apologise if I-y'know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y'know it's just the hormones, y'know."
Rachel Green,Scared,4,22,10,6,No we...
Monica Geller,Scared,4,22,10,7,Hormones.
Rachel Green,Scared,4,22,10,8,"...hormones, yeah."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,22,10,9,"Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,22,10,10,"Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That's great. So how-how are things going?"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,22,10,11,"Good. Y'know-no-no, okay, it's-it feels like everything's been about me lately, so what's happening with you?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,22,10,12,"Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,22,10,13,Oh!
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,22,10,14,"It just might be too hard, given the history and all that..."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,22,10,15,"Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him."
Rachel Green,Sad,4,22,10,16,"Well, h-how is this like that?"
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,4,22,10,17,"Well, let's see, it's not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y'know a bunch of y'know high school crap that nobody really gives y'know..."
Rachel Green,Sad,4,22,10,18,"I'm-I'm sorry, I just thought that..."
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,22,10,19,"Alrighty, here come the water works."
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,22,11,2,"Ugh! I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?"
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,22,11,3,Hey guys!
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,22,11,4,Hey!
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,22,11,5,Hey...
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,22,11,6,"I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so..."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,22,11,7,"So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,22,11,8,"Yeah, right!"
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,22,11,9,"I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those..."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,22,11,10,"That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,22,11,11,"So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?"
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,22,11,12,"Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,22,11,13,"So you might say, it's a magic ring."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,22,11,14,"Yeah, the stripper stole it."
Ross Geller,Scared,4,22,11,15,My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,22,11,16,"Well, I think it all started when you said, ""Hey Joey, why don't you be my best man."""
Ross Geller,Scared,4,22,11,17,"All right-all right, fine! I-I'm gonna call the cops!"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,22,11,18,"Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!"
Ross Geller,Mad,4,22,11,19,Not on you! On the stripper!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,22,11,20,"Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,22,11,21,"Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,22,11,22,"I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, ""If I bothered them again they'd call the police."" I said, ""If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"""
Ross Geller,Scared,4,22,11,23,"So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,22,11,24,"Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I..."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,22,11,25,"Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,22,11,26,"Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!"
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,22,12,2,Here's your tea Phoebe.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,22,12,3,"It's so good. Oh, thanks."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,22,12,4,Good.
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,22,12,5,I'm so glad you liked it.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,22,12,6,Oh!
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,22,12,7,What?!
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,22,12,8,What?! She made the tea!
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,22,12,9,"Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,22,12,10,You what?
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,22,12,11,Oh my God!
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,22,12,12,"Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one."
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,22,12,13,"Wait, you can't have the baby here! I mean I haven't sterilised it since the guys moved out!"
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,22,12,14,"Okay. It's okay. We're gonna be okay. Y'know what? It's okay. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,22,12,15,"No. It's all right; it's probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,22,12,16,"Rachel, get the book! The book!"
Rachel Green,Scared,4,22,12,17,Okay! Okay! Here!
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,22,12,18,The Bible?!
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,22,12,19,I don't know!
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,22,13,2,"All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong."
Ross Geller,Scared,4,22,13,3,Diverse.
The Stripper,Scared,4,22,13,5,Did anybody call for security?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,22,13,6,You be cool.
The Stripper,Neutral,4,22,13,7,"Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? Hey, Joey?"
Ross Geller,Scared,4,22,13,8,Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,22,13,9,"Way to be cool, man."
The Stripper,Mad,4,22,13,10,What's he talking about?
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,22,13,11,"There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!"
The Stripper,Mad,4,22,13,12,"Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?"
The Guys,Neutral,4,22,13,13,Yeah!
Ross Geller,Mad,4,22,13,14,We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
The Stripper,Powerful,4,22,13,15,"Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don't need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,22,13,16,Marry me.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,22,16,2,If anything should happen to him...
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,22,16,3,Joey! The vet said it's a simple procedure.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,22,16,4,So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,22,16,5,"He will, Joe."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,22,16,6,"Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,22,16,8,"I'm so worried about him, y'know?"
The Doctor,Powerful,4,22,16,9,Somebody lose a ring?
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,22,16,10,Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,22,16,11,H-h-h-how's the duck?
The Doctor,Powerful,4,22,16,12,"He's doing just fine, he's resting now, but you can see him in a little bit."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,22,16,13,"Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this."
Ross Geller,Sad,4,22,16,14,"No, that's all right."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,22,16,15,"No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!"
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,22,16,16,"Hey, come on, it's not your fault."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,22,16,17,"Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,22,16,18,"No, you should."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,22,16,19,"Now, don't argue with me..."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,22,16,20,"Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys."
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,22,16,21,Really?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,22,16,22,Really?
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,22,16,23,"Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are my... I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good..."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,22,16,24,Thanks man.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,22,16,25,I gotta go check something over here.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,22,16,26,What a baby.
Ross Geller,Sad,4,22,16,27,Total wuss!
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,23,1,2,"Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,23,1,3,Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,23,1,4,What do you got there?
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,23,1,5,"Condoms, dude!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,23,1,6,How come the writing is in Spanish?
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,23,1,7,Don't read my condoms!
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,23,1,9,"Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,23,1,10,"Who are you saying ""check"" too?"
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,23,1,11,"Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! My mom does it, I never realised it was weird."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,23,1,12,"Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird."
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,23,1,13,Hey!
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,23,1,14,Hey!
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,23,1,15,Hey! Are you ready yet?
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,23,1,16,Yep! You got the tickets?
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,23,1,17,"Oh! Got 'em right here, check!"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,23,1,19,"It's all London, baby! Here we go."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,23,1,20,You got your passport?
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,23,1,21,"Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,23,1,23,Ohh!!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,23,1,24,There it is.
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,23,3,2,Come on! Do something!
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,23,3,3,"I am, I'm ignoring you."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,23,3,4,"Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey."
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,23,3,5,"Oh, what the hell is that?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,23,3,6,"It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map."
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,23,3,7,"Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,23,3,8,I got it! Here we go.
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,23,3,9,"Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?"
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,23,3,10,"Shhh! Man, you made me lose it!"
Emily Waltham,Scared,4,23,4,2,"...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be..."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,23,4,3,"Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, honey, okay?"
Emily Waltham,Peaceful,4,23,4,4,"Well, up yours too!"
Ross Geller,Scared,4,23,4,5,What?!
Emily Waltham,Scared,4,23,4,6,"Oh, that's not what it means?"
Ross Geller,Sad,4,23,4,7,No! No! That's-that's time-out!
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,23,4,8,Sorry.
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,23,4,9,"Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on."
Monica Geller,Scared,4,23,4,10,Chicken Kiev?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,23,4,11,Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,23,4,12,"Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the chickenella... So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!"
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,23,4,13,"Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here."
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,23,4,14,I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... Oh my God!
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,23,4,15,It's nice.
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,23,4,16,Oh. Oh.
Emily Waltham,Powerful,4,23,4,18,Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,23,4,19,It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
Emily Waltham,Powerful,4,23,4,20,How's it gonna be all right?!
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,23,4,21,"Uh-huh, I see that."
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,23,4,22,"Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened."
Ross Geller,Scared,4,23,4,23,What? What?
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,23,4,24,They tore it down a few days early.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,23,6,2,"All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,23,6,3,"I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place."
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,23,6,4,Really? To what?
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,23,6,5,To Put the Camera Away!!!
Joey Tribbiani,Mad,4,23,6,6,"Man, you are Westminster Crabby."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,23,7,2,Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.
Monica Geller,Mad,4,23,7,4,Oowww!!
Dressmaker,Neutral,4,23,7,5,Sorry. Lucky this dress is red!
Emily Waltham,Mad,4,23,7,6,We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,23,7,7,"You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!"
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,23,7,8,"I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,23,7,9,"But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's gonna like you better than me."
Monica Geller,Scared,4,23,7,11,"Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,23,8,2,Oh. Oh.
Rachel Green,Scared,4,23,8,3,"Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?"
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,23,8,4,"Oh, no. Oh, nothing."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,23,8,5,Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,23,8,6,"Okay, I have a wedgie."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,23,8,7,"Okay, that is all you."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,23,8,8,"So-so, what do you want for lunch?"
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,23,8,9,"Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,23,8,10,"Yeah, I do. What's the matter?"
Rachel Green,Scared,4,23,8,11,I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,23,8,12,"Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married..."
Rachel Green,Scared,4,23,8,13,Still in love with?!
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,23,8,14,Yeah!
Rachel Green,Mad,4,23,8,15,I'm not in love with Ross!
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,23,8,16,"Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither."
Rachel Green,Mad,4,23,8,17,"Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean, hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,23,8,18,We thought you knew!
Rachel Green,Scared,4,23,8,19,We?!
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,23,8,20,"Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!"
Rachel Green,Scared,4,23,8,21,You all know? Does Ross know?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,23,8,22,"Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything."
Rachel Green,Mad,4,23,8,23,"Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!"
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,23,8,24,"Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, ""Hey, you like things clean."" Or, y'know, ""Hey, Joey, you're gay."""
Rachel Green,Scared,4,23,8,26,What?!
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,23,8,27,"Oh, please! She's always got a broom in her hand!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,23,9,2,Hey!
The Vendor,Neutral,4,23,9,3,"So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards..."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,23,9,4,Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,23,9,5,"Well, I don't have to buy that, ""I'm with stupid"" T-shirt anymore."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,23,9,6,"Well, I like it. Here you go."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,23,9,7,"All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?"
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,23,9,8,"Oh, I embarrass you?"
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,23,9,9,How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
The Vendor,Scared,4,23,9,10,He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,23,9,11,Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
The Vendor,Peaceful,4,23,9,12,They're all tourists.
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,23,9,13,"All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,23,9,14,Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
The Vendor,Powerful,4,23,9,15,Good choice.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,23,9,16,Thanks.
Chandler Bing,Mad,4,23,9,17,"Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,23,9,19,"How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America."
Emily Waltham,Neutral,4,23,10,2,Hello?
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,23,10,3,"Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding."
Emily Waltham,Sad,4,23,10,4,We don't have to.
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,23,10,5,Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
Emily Waltham,Sad,4,23,10,6,"No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit."
Ross Geller,Neutral,4,23,10,7,She said what?
Emily Waltham,Scared,4,23,10,8,"She said, ""If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."""
Ross Geller,Mad,4,23,10,9,"Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? This isn't right."
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,23,10,10,"I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right."
Ross Geller,Scared,4,23,10,11,I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
Emily Waltham,Scared,4,23,10,12,"Don't you point your pants at me! We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about."
Ross Geller,Scared,4,23,10,13,The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.
Emily Waltham,Mad,4,23,10,14,So what are you saying? It's now or never?
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,23,10,15,No. I'm saying it's now.
Emily Waltham,Scared,4,23,10,16,Or?
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,23,10,17,There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
Emily Waltham,Mad,4,23,10,18,"It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!"
Ross Geller,Scared,4,23,10,19,"No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,23,13,2,Ooh! I thought of a good flaw! Ross pops his gum!
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,23,13,3,"Oh, right! Wait a minute, I do that too."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,4,23,13,4,"Yeah, I know. It drives me crazy."
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,23,13,6,I'll get it.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,23,13,8,Hello.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,23,13,9,"Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!"
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,23,13,10,"Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,23,13,11,"That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,23,13,12,"Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?"
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,23,13,13,"Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,4,23,13,14,So you're not homesick yet?
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,23,13,15,"No, I don't think so."
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,4,23,13,16,"All right, the seven of us miss you."
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,23,13,17,Who's seven?
Phoebe Buffay,Sad,4,23,13,18,"Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies..."
Joey Tribbiani,Sad,4,23,13,19,"Ahh, the babies miss me?"
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,23,13,20,Of course they do! Or I'm just really hungry.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,23,13,22,"Ooh, the pizza guy's here!"
Joey Tribbiani,Neutral,4,23,13,23,What? You ordered pizza without me?!
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,23,13,24,"Yeah. But y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey Special."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,23,13,25,Two pizzas?!

Emily Waltham,Mad,4,23,14,2,"Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!"
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,23,14,3,You'll see.
Emily Waltham,Mad,4,23,14,4,"I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen."
Emily Waltham,Powerful,4,23,14,6,Oh God.
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,23,14,7,"Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles..."
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,23,14,8,"And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,23,14,9,"But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it's fine, whatever you want."
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,23,14,10,It's perfect.
Ross Geller,Scared,4,23,14,11,"And, I don't know, if it starts to rain..."
Emily Waltham,Joyful,4,23,14,12,Well then we'll get wet.
Monica Geller,Sad,4,23,14,13,Ohh. And I don't even have a date.
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,23,15,2,Pheebs?
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,23,15,3,Yeah?
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,23,15,4,Do you remember where the duck food is?
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,23,15,5,"Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?"
Rachel Green,Joyful,4,23,15,6,Because I'm going to London.
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,23,15,7,What?! What do you mean you're going to London?
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,23,15,8,"Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,23,15,9,"But what about all the ""finding-his-flaws"" stuff we've been doing?"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,23,15,10,"Yeah, that didn't work."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,23,15,11,"I-Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!"
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,23,15,12,"Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision."
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,23,15,13,"That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."""
Rachel Green,Scared,4,23,15,14,Ohh-Do you think he will?!
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,23,15,15,"No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over."
Rachel Green,Powerful,4,23,15,16,"Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, ""I do."""
Phoebe Buffay,Joyful,4,23,15,17,"I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter."
Housekeeper,Neutral,4,24,1,2,The Waltham Residence.
Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,24,1,3,Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily's Parents' house.
Housekeeper,Peaceful,4,24,1,4,"This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak."
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,24,1,5,What are you saying?!
Housekeeper,Peaceful,4,24,1,6,"Now, let us try that again, shall we?"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,24,1,8,No! Ooh! Oh my god!

Phoebe Buffay,Neutral,4,24,1,10,"Hello. This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?"
Housekeeper,Sad,4,24,1,11,"Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it's not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye."
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,24,1,12,"No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?"
Housekeeper,Neutral,4,24,1,13,"I'm afraid, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,4,24,1,14,"Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire."
Housekeeper,Scared,4,24,1,15,Hangs up.
Phoebe Buffay,Powerful,4,24,1,16,"Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass."
Monica Geller,Neutral,4,24,2,2,Hey.

Jack Geller,Scared,4,24,2,17,"Ohh forget it. Too hell with tradition, we're happy to do it."
Judy Geller,Joyful,4,24,2,18,"We know how expensive weddings can be, besides this may be the only wedding we get to throw ."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,24,2,19,"Ha ha, a joke that's funny in all countries."
Waiter,Peaceful,4,24,3,2,Sir?
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,24,3,3,What's in it?
Waiter,Neutral,4,24,3,4,"Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta."
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,24,3,5,"That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like."
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,24,3,6,"Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself."
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,24,3,7,Your different here too. Your mean in England.
Jack Geller,Mad,4,24,3,9,What the hell!!!
Ross Geller,Scared,4,24,3,10,"what's up, Dad?"
Jack Geller,Powerful,4,24,3,11,This bill for my half of the wedding. it's insane.
Judy Geller,Peaceful,4,24,3,12,How could it be so much? The receptions at their house.
Jack Geller,Mad,4,24,3,13,"Flowers, liquor, recarpet first floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I'm paying to remodel this guys house. I'm going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,24,3,14,"Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?"
Jack Geller,Scared,4,24,3,15,And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.
Judy Geller,Peaceful,4,24,3,16,"Ooh, Jack.... Sometimes I forget how powerful you can be."
Monica Geller,Sad,4,24,3,17,And I'm going to go get drunk.
Rachel Green,Peaceful,4,24,4,2,"Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. Hi."
Ticket Agent,Joyful,4,24,4,3,Hello.
Rachel Green,Scared,4,24,4,4,"Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?"

Ticket Agent,Neutral,4,24,4,13,They prefer it if I don't barter.
Rachel Green,Scared,4,24,4,14,"Ohh, I just don't think I have enough left on my credit card."
Ticket Agent,Neutral,4,24,4,15,Well you can split it with another credit card.
Rachel Green,Scared,4,24,4,16,"Ohh, okay, how about five. Ohh, thank you."
Ticket Agent,Powerful,4,24,4,17,I'm just going to need to see your passport.
Rachel Green,Scared,4,24,4,18,"Okay, you know what? I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand, and...okay. But you know what? I have my drivers license and I have a twenty."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,24,5,2,"Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn."
Stephen Waltham,Neutral,4,24,5,3,"Ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments."
Ross Geller,Mad,4,24,5,4,"I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face."
Andrea Waltham,Mad,4,24,5,5,"This is ridiculous. I mean we had an agreement. Will you say something, Steven?! Please!!!"
Stephen Waltham,Powerful,4,24,5,6,Don't take that tone with me. All-all right you can.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,24,7,2,"I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him.. Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God.."

Andrea Waltham,Scared,4,24,7,7,Where did you get this number?
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,24,7,8,"I got it from your maid. She's a bitch, but I wore her down."
Andrea Waltham,Powerful,4,24,7,9,"Well, if you're one of Ross's best friends, why aren't you here?"
Phoebe Buffay,Peaceful,4,24,7,10,"Yeah, um, I can't fly. I'm having my brother's babies."
Andrea Waltham,Joyful,4,24,7,11,"Oh, am I on the radio?"
Phoebe Buffay,Scared,4,24,7,12,"No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It's very very important."
Andrea Waltham,Sad,4,24,7,13,"No, I'm bored with you now. I'm going to cut you off."
Phoebe Buffay,Mad,4,24,7,14,"Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,24,7,15,"And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily."

I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. But not as much as I love America. Could we please..go home now?"
Felicity,Joyful,4,24,7,18,Are you going home? I was hoping to get to know you better.
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,24,7,19,"I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart."
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,24,8,2,I was laughing.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,24,8,3,Out loud?
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,24,8,4,Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,24,8,5,So how are you doing?
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,24,8,6,"My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. I'm not going to let anything spoil that."
Drunk Man,Peaceful,4,24,8,7,I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,24,8,8,"Well, thanks, we like him."
Drunk Man,Scared,4,24,8,9,My god!! You must have been a teenage when you had him.
Jack Geller,Mad,4,24,8,11,"There's no way in hell, I'm paying for it."
Ross Geller,Joyful,4,24,8,12,"Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding."
Jack Geller,Powerful,4,24,8,13,"All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,24,8,15,"The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother."
Monica Geller,Mad,4,24,8,16,Then why would he say it?
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,24,8,17,Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
Monica Geller,Sad,4,24,8,18,"Oh, my mother's right. I'm never going to get married."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,24,8,19,"Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn't want you?"
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,24,8,20,"Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!!"

Rachel Green,Powerful,4,24,9,6,"Okay, you know what? You're going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up."
Ticket Agent,Neutral,4,24,9,7,I can't do that.
Rachel Green,Scared,4,24,9,8,"Sure, you know what? Come on, we'll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the ""engine""."
Ticket Agent,Neutral,4,24,9,9,"I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to step aside, Miss."
Rachel Green,Neutral,4,24,9,10,"Look, If I don't get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!"

Monica Geller,Joyful,4,24,21,4,"Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,24,21,5,"Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser."
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,24,21,6,Okay!
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,24,21,7,Okay!
Ross Geller,Scared,4,24,21,9,Emily?!

Monica Geller,Scared,4,24,21,11,You didn't find her?
Ross Geller,Scared,4,24,21,12,"No, I've looked everywhere!"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,24,21,13,"Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,24,21,14,"Yeah, I think you should keep looking!"
Chandler Bing,Neutral,4,24,21,15,"Yeah, for about 30 minutes."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,24,21,16,Or 45.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,24,21,17,"Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,24,21,18,"No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,24,21,19,"Well, it's getting late."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,24,21,20,"Yeah, we're gonna go."
Ross Geller,Peaceful,4,24,21,21,"Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?"
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,24,21,22,"Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York."
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,24,21,23,"Yeah, it's a very large plane."
Ross Geller,Powerful,4,24,21,24,That's cool.
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,24,21,25,"But, we'll stay here with you."

Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,24,22,2,We have to leave for New York in an hour.
Monica Geller,Scared,4,24,22,3,"I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?"
Chandler Bing,Scared,4,24,22,4,"We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it."
Ross Geller,Scared,4,24,22,6,Em-Emily? Em-Emily? Emily!
Stephen Waltham,Scared,4,24,22,7,No.
Andrea Waltham,Powerful,4,24,22,8,"You can forget about Emily, she's not with us."
Stephen Waltham,Scared,4,24,22,9,We've come for her things.
Ross Geller,Scared,4,24,22,10,"Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?"
Stephen Waltham,Mad,4,24,22,11,She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.
Andrea Waltham,Joyful,4,24,22,12,"We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious."
Stephen Waltham,Powerful,4,24,22,13,"Excuse me, I'm standing right here!"
Andrea Waltham,Joyful,4,24,22,14,"Oh yes, there you are."

Ross Geller,Mad,4,24,22,17,"Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that."
Stephen Waltham,Joyful,4,24,22,18,"All right, I'll tell her. Come on bugger face!"
Andrea Waltham,Joyful,4,24,22,19,Call me.
Stephen Waltham,Mad,4,24,22,20,"You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!"
Monica Geller,Joyful,4,24,23,2,"Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again."
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,24,23,3,"Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters."
Monica Geller,Powerful,4,24,23,4,"I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?"
Chandler Bing,Powerful,4,24,23,5,'Kay!
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,24,23,7,Can I ask you something?
Chandler Bing,Sad,4,24,23,8,"Uhh, no."
Joey Tribbiani,Joyful,4,24,23,9,"Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, ""I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant."" Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?"
Chandler Bing,Joyful,4,24,23,10,No.
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,24,23,11,"I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?"
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,24,23,12,Yes.
Joey Tribbiani,Peaceful,4,24,23,13,Thanks man.
Chandler Bing,Peaceful,4,24,23,14,Okay man.
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,24,23,15,But what about how much taller he is than me?
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,24,23,17,"I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?"
Joey Tribbiani,Scared,4,24,23,19,"Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour."
Monica Geller,Peaceful,4,24,23,20,I know!
Joey Tribbiani,Powerful,4,24,23,21,"Had the beef-tips, huh?"
