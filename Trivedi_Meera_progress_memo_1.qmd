## Memo format

Like all other submissions for this course, we expect the memo to be neat and well organized.

You should make this document your own. This is a template. To help with this we have added a date to the yaml above (good whenever writing memos). You should remove this block when making this document your own.

::: {.callout-warning}
GitHub (free account) cannot store large files. If you try to commit and push a large dataset you will have an ERROR! Any file over 100 MB (100,000 KB) needs to be added to the `.gitignore` file BEFORE committing.

**We may need to do that for files in your final project!**
